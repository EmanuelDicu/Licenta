        "correct_solution": "A sphere with radius 9 inches has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(9^3)=4\\cdot 9^2 \\cdot 3\\pi$ cubic inches; twice this is $8\\cdot 9^2\\cdot 3 \\pi$ cubic inches.  Let the radius of the larger sphere be $r$, so we have \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3= 8\\cdot 9^2\\cdot 3\\pi .\\] Solving for $r$ yields \\[r^3 =2\\cdot 9^3 \\Rightarrow r = 9\\sqrt[3]{2}.\\]  The diameter is twice this value, or $18\\sqrt[3]{2}$ inches.  Hence $a=18$, $b=2$, and $a+b=\\boxed{20}$.",

The smaller sphere has radius 9 inches, so its volume is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (9^3) = 972\\pi$ cubic inches.\n\n2. **Find the volume of the larger sphere:** The larger sphere has twice the volume of the smaller sphere, so its volume is $2 \\cdot 972\\pi = 1944\\pi$ cubic inches.\n\n3. **Find the radius of the larger sphere:** Let $R$ be the radius of the larger sphere.  We have the equation $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3 = 1944\\pi$.  Dividing both sides by $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$ gives $R^3 = 1458$.  Taking the cube root of both sides gives $R = \\sqrt[3]{1458}$.\n\n4. **Find the diameter of the larger sphere:** The diameter is twice the radius, so the diameter is $2\\sqrt[3]{1458} = 2\\sqrt[3]{27 \\cdot 54} = 2 \\cdot 3 \\sqrt[3]{54} = 6\\sqrt[3]{54}$ inches.\n\n5. **Compute a + b:** We have $a=6$ and $b=54$, so $a+b = 6+54 = \\boxed{60}$. \n"
