To find the slope, we can pick two different values of t and calculate the slope using the two corresponding points of intersection.\n   - Let's take t = 0 and t = 1.\n   - For t = 0, the point is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{5}{3}\\right)$.\n   - For t = 1, the point is $\\left(\\frac{12}{3}, \\frac{10}{3}\\right) = (4, \\frac{10}{3})$.\n   - The slope is then $\\frac{\\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{5}{3}}{4 - \\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{5/3}{11/3} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{11}}$. \n"
