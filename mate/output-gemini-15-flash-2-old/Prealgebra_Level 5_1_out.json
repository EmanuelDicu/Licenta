Therefore, the area of the triangle is $\\frac12 sh$. Since these areas are equal, we have \\[\\frac12sh=s^2.\\] Dividing both sides by $s$ and multiplying both sides by 2 gives $h = \\boxed{2s}$.",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "1. **Find the area of the square:** The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the square is $s^2$.\n\n2. **Find the base of the triangle:** Since the triangle and square have the same area, the area of the triangle is also $s^2$.  The base of the triangle is the same as the side length of the square, which is $s$.\n\n3. **Use the area formula for a triangle:** The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height. We know the area is $s^2$ and the base is $s$, so we can set up the equation: $(1/2) * s * h = s^2$.\n\n4. **Solve for *h*:**  Divide both sides of the equation by (1/2) * s to get: $h = \\frac{s^2}{(1/2)s} = \\boxed{2s}$. \n"
