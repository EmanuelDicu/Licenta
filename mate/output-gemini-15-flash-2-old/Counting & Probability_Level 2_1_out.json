        "correct_solution": "Because non-overlapping regions that share a side cannot be the same color, the only way to color the grid is to have diagonal squares sharing the same color. So, Jessica can either color the top left and bottom right squares with color $1$ and the top right and bottom left squares with color $2$, or color the top left and bottom right squares with color $2$ and the top left and bottom right squares with color $1$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ ways in which to color the grid.",

There's only 1 possible color for square B.\n\n3. **Consider Square C:** Square C shares a side with both A and B. Since A and B are opposite colors, C must be the same color as A. There's only 1 possible color for C.\n\n4. **Consider Square D:** Square D shares a side with both B and C, which are the same color. So, D must be the opposite color, which means there's only 1 possible color for D.\n\nTherefore, there are **2** possible ways for Jessica to color the grid. \n"
