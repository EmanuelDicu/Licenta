The order in which we choose the people for the committee doesn't matter (choosing John then Sarah then Bill is the same as choosing Bill then Sarah then John).\n\n**Solution**\n\nHere's how to solve it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Consider the choices for each spot:**\n\n   *  For the first spot on our committee, we have 8 options (any of the 8 people).\n   *  For the second spot, we only have 7 people remaining.\n   *  For the third spot, we have 6 people remaining.\n\n2. **Calculate the total potential combinations:**\n\n   * It seems like we have 8 * 7 * 6 = 336 ways to choose the committee. \n\n3. **Account for overcounting:**\n\n   *  We've overcounted! Why? Because we've counted groups like (John, Sarah, Bill), (John, Bill, Sarah), (Bill, John, Sarah), etc., as different groups when they are actually the same committee. \n\n4. **Correct for overcounting:**\n\n   *  We need to figure out how many times we've overcounted each group.  For any group of 3, there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to order them: 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 ways.\n   *  Therefore, we've counted each unique group 6 times.\n\n5. **Find the final answer:**\n\n   * Divide the initial count by the overcounting factor: 336 / 6 = 56\n\n**Solution Summary**\n\nThere are **56** ways to choose a 3-person committee from a group of 8 people.\n\n**Formula**\n\nThis type of problem is a combination problem, and it can be solved directly using the following formula:\n\n*  nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!) \n   * Where n is the total number of items (8 people)\n   * r is the number of items to choose (3 people on the committee)\n\n*  8C3 = 8! / (3! * 5!) = 56 \n"
