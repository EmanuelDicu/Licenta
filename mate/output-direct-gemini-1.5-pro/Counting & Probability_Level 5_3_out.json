        "correct_solution": "We know that the number of subsets of any given set is equal to $2^n,$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the set. First, then, we need to find the number of composite divisors. The prime factorization of $72$ is $72=2^3 \\cdot 3^2,$ so there are $(3+1)(2+1)=12$ total divisors. (To see this, note that we can form a divisor of the form $2^a 3^b$ by freely choosing $a=0,1,2,3$ and $b=0,1,2$). Of these, $1$ is neither prime nor composite, and $2$ and $3$ are prime, for a total of $9$ composite divisors. Therefore there are $2^9=\\boxed{512}$ subsets of the divisors of $72$ with only composite divisors.",

            "gemini-1.5-pro": "## Solving the Subset Problem\n\nHere's how we can break down this counting problem:\n\n**1. Find the Divisors:**\n\n* Begin by finding all the divisors of 72. \n* We can do this by listing out factor pairs: 1 and 72, 2 and 36, 3 and 24, 4 and 18, 6 and 12, 8 and 9.\n* Therefore, the divisors of 72 are: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72}.\n\n**2. Identify Composite Divisors:**\n\n* Recall that a composite number has more than two factors (including 1 and itself).\n* Identify the composite numbers within the set of divisors: {4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72}.\n\n**3. Count Subsets of Composite Divisors:**\n\n* We need to find how many subsets can be formed using only these composite divisors.\n* Consider that for each composite divisor, we have two choices: include it in a subset or not.\n* Since we have 9 composite divisors, there are 2 options for each, giving us a total of 2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2 = 2^9 = 512 subsets.\n\n**4. Include the Empty Set:**\n\n* The problem states we should include the empty set, which is a subset of every set.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTherefore, there are **513** subsets of the divisors of 72 that contain only composite numbers (including the empty set). \n"
