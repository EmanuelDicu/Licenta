            "gemini-1.5-pro": "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Move all terms to one side:**\n\n   Begin by setting the equation to zero.  Subtract 41t from both sides to get:\n\n   $$6t^2 - 41t + 30 = 0$$\n\n**2. Factor the quadratic equation:**\n\n   We need to find two numbers that multiply to (6)(30) = 180 and add up to -41.  These numbers are -15 and -12. Now, rewrite the middle term and factor by grouping:\n\n   $$6t^2 - 15t - 12t + 30 = 0$$\n\n   $$3t(2t - 5) - 6(2t - 5) = 0$$\n\n   $$(2t - 5)(3t - 6) = 0$$\n\n**3. Solve for 't':**\n\n   For the product of two factors to equal zero, at least one of the factors must be zero.  Set each factor equal to zero and solve:\n\n   *  2t - 5 = 0  -->  2t = 5  -->  t = 5/2 \n   *  3t - 6 = 0  -->  3t = 6  -->  t = 2\n\n**4. Find the positive difference:**\n\n   The solutions to the equation are t = 5/2 and t = 2. The positive difference between these solutions is:\n\n   5/2 - 2 = 1/2\n\n**Therefore, the positive difference between the solutions to the equation is 1/2.** \n"
