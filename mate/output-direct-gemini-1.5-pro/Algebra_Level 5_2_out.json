Distribute:**\n\n* The first step is to get rid of the parentheses by distributing the numbers outside them:\n\n   ```\n   -13(r + 5) + 25 > 4(r - 10) \n   -13r - 65 + 25 > 4r - 40 \n   ```\n\n**2. Simplify:**\n\n* Combine the constant terms on both sides of the inequality:\n\n   ```\n   -13r - 40 > 4r - 40\n   ```\n\n**3. Isolate 'r' terms:**\n\n* To get all the 'r' terms on one side, add 13r to both sides:\n\n   ```\n   -13r - 40 + 13r > 4r - 40 + 13r\n   -40 > 17r - 40\n   ```\n\n**4. Isolate the constant term:**\n\n* Add 40 to both sides to isolate the 'r' term: \n\n   ```\n   -40 + 40 > 17r - 40 + 40\n   0 > 17r \n   ```\n\n**5. Solve for 'r':**\n\n* Divide both sides by 17 to solve for 'r':\n\n   ```\n   0/17 > 17r/17\n   0 > r\n   ```\n\n**6. Express in interval notation:**\n\n* Since 'r' is strictly less than 0, the solution in interval notation is:\n\n   ```\n   (-\u221e, 0) \n   ```\n\n**Therefore, the solution to the inequality -13(r+5) + 25 > 4(r-10) is r \u2208 (-\u221e, 0).** \n"
