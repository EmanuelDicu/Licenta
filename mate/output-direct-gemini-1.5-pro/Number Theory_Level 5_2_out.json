Our goal is to find the value of the expression `a\u00b2 - 4a + 1`.\n\n**Solution**\n\n**Part 1: Prime Factorization of the LCM**\n\n* First, find the prime factorization of 10508:\n   10508 = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 2627 \n   2627 is a prime number.\n\n* This tells us that the LCM of  `a + 1` and `a - 5` is divisible by 2\u00b2 and 2627.\n\n**Part 2: Analyzing the Factors**\n\n* Since `a + 1` and `a - 5` are consecutive even numbers, one of them must be divisible by 2, and the other must be divisible by 4 (2\u00b2).\n* Since 2627 is a prime number, one of the numbers (`a + 1` or `a - 5`) must be divisible by 2627.\n\n**Part 3: Determining 'a'**\n\n*  Let's consider the possibilities:\n    * **Case 1:** If `a + 1` is divisible by 2627, then `a - 5` would be divisible by 4. However,  `2627 - 6` is not divisible by 4, so this case is not possible.\n    * **Case 2:** If `a - 5` is divisible by 2627, then `a + 1` would be divisible by 4. This is a possibility.\n\n* Since `a - 5` is divisible by 2627, let's assume `a - 5 = 2627`. \n* Solving for `a`, we get `a = 2627 + 5 = 2632`.\n\n**Part 4: Calculating the Expression**\n\n* Now that we know `a = 2632`, we can calculate `a\u00b2 - 4a + 1`:\n   (2632)\u00b2 - 4(2632) + 1 \n   = 6927424 - 10528 + 1\n   = 6916897\n\n**Solution**\n\nTherefore, the value of `a\u00b2 - 4a + 1` is **6916897**. \n"
