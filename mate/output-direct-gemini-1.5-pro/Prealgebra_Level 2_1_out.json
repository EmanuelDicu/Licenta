        "problem": "Sarah, James, and Matthew are on a team in a game show. In the game, Sarah always earns 5 points, Matthew always earns -2 points, and James always earns 3 points. To calculate their team's score, they multiply the first person's score by the second person's score, then subtract the third person's score. If they can choose the order in which they play the game, what is the maximum possible score that their team can earn?",
        "correct_solution": "If we let the first, second, and third persons' score equal $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively, then their team's score is $((a \\cdot b)-c)$.  We may test all six possible orderings:\n$a = 5$, $b = -2$, $c = 3 \\rightarrow ((5 \\cdot (-2)) - 3) = -13$\n$a = -2$, $b = 5$, $c = 3 \\rightarrow (((-2) \\cdot 5) - 3) = -13$\n$a = 5$, $b = 3$, $c = -2 \\rightarrow ((5 \\cdot 3) - (-2)) = 17$\n$a = 3$, $b = 5$, $c = -2 \\rightarrow ((3 \\cdot 5) - (-2)) = 17$\n$a = 3$, $b = -2$, $c = 5 \\rightarrow ((3 \\cdot (-2)) - 5) = -11$\n$a = -2$, $b = 3$, $c = 5 \\rightarrow (((-2) \\cdot 3) - 5) = -11$\nThus, our total answer is $\\boxed{17}$\nAdditionally, we may note that the only way to obtain a positive answer is to multiply the two positive scores together and subtract the negative score.  Because multiplication is commutative, the order of $a$ and $b$ does not matter, and we need only compute the single case $(3 \\cdot 5) - (-2) = \\boxed{17}$",

            "gemini-1.5-pro": "Here's how we can break down the problem to solve it:\n\n**1. Understand the scoring system:**\n\n* Sarah always scores 5 points.\n* Matthew always scores -2 points.\n* James always scores 3 points.\n* Score calculation: (Person 1's score * Person 2's score) - Person 3's score\n\n**2.  Experiment with different orders:**\n\nOur goal is to maximize the score. Since we are multiplying two scores and then subtracting the third, let's try to get the largest possible product before the subtraction.\n\n* **Consider the impact of negative multiplication:**  Multiplying a positive number by a negative number results in a negative product. \n\n* **Maximize the first two numbers:** To get the largest product, we want the two largest positive numbers (5 and 3) to be multiplied. This means Sarah and James should be the first two players.\n\n**3.  Determine the best order:**\n\n* **Option 1: Sarah, James, Matthew**\n   (5 * 3) - (-2) = 15 + 2 = 17\n\n* **Option 2: James, Sarah, Matthew**\n    (3 * 5) - (-2) = 15 + 2 = 17\n\nBoth of these options give us the same maximum score.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe maximum possible score the team can earn is **17**. They can achieve this by having either Sarah and then James, or James and then Sarah play first, with Matthew going last. \n"
