            "gemini-1.5-pro": "Here's a breakdown of how to solve this problem, splitting it into manageable parts:\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\n* **Complex Numbers:** We're dealing with complex numbers. Recall that a complex number is of the form  *z = a + bi*, where *i* is the imaginary unit (*i*\u00b2 = -1), and *a* and *b* are real numbers.\n* **Modulus:** The modulus of a complex number *z = a + bi*, denoted by |*z*|, is its distance from the origin in the complex plane and is calculated as |*z*| = \u221a(*a*\u00b2 + *b*\u00b2).\n* **Geometric Interpretation:**  The condition |*z*| = 1 means *z* lies on the unit circle in the complex plane (the circle centered at the origin with radius 1).\n\n**Solution**\n\n**Part 1: Geometric Insight**\n\nLet's represent the complex numbers geometrically:\n\n* Let O be the origin (0, 0) in the complex plane.\n* Since |*z*| = 1, let's represent *z* as a point on the unit circle. \n* The expression |1 + *z*| represents the distance between the point -1 on the real axis and the point *z*.\n* To understand |1 - *z* + *z*\u00b2|, let's manipulate it:\n    *  1 - *z* + *z*\u00b2 = *z*\u00b2 - *z* + 1 = (*z* - 1/2)\u00b2 + 3/4 \n    *  Thus, |1 - *z* + *z*\u00b2| represents the distance between the point *z* and the point 1/2 in the complex plane.\n\n**Part 2: Triangle Inequality**\n\nThe Triangle Inequality states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than or equal to the length of the third side.\n\n* Consider the points O (0, 0),  A(-1, 0), and Z representing *z* in the complex plane. These points form a triangle.\n* By the Triangle Inequality:  OA + AZ \u2265 OZ\n\nNow let's relate this back to our complex number expressions:\n\n* OA = |-1 - 0| = 1\n* AZ = |*z* - (-1)| = |1 + *z*|\n* OZ = |*z* - 0| = |*z*| = 1\n\nTherefore, our inequality becomes:\n\n1 + |1 + *z*| \u2265 1 \n\u21d2 |1 + *z*| \u2265 0  (This is always true)\n\n**Part 3: Maximizing the Expression**\n\nWe want to maximize: |1 + *z*| + |1 - *z* + *z*\u00b2|\n\n* From Part 2, we know  |1 + *z*|  is minimized (and equal to 0) when *z* = -1.  \n*  Let's consider what happens to  |1 - *z* + *z*\u00b2| when *z* = -1:\n    * |1 - (-1) + (-1)\u00b2| = |3| = 3\n\n*  Therefore, the maximum value of the expression occurs when *z* = -1, and the maximum value is 0 + 3 = 3.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe maximum value of |1 + *z*| + |1 - *z* + *z*\u00b2|, where |*z*| = 1, is **3**. \n"
