Let's plug these values into the formula:\n\n   $$\\binom{15}{2} = \\dfrac{15!}{2!(15-2)!}$$\n\n3. **Simplifying the Factorials:**  Let's expand the factorials and simplify:\n\n   $$\\binom{15}{2} = \\dfrac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 13!}$$\n\n   Notice that 13! appears in both the numerator and denominator, so we can cancel them:\n\n   $$\\binom{15}{2} = \\dfrac{15 \\times 14}{2 \\times 1}$$\n\n4. **Calculating the Result:** Finally, perform the multiplication:\n\n   $$\\binom{15}{2} = \\dfrac{210}{2} = 105$$\n\n**Answer**\n\nThere are **105** ways to choose a group of 2 objects from a set of 15 distinct objects. \n"
