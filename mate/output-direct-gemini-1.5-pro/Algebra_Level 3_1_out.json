            "gemini-1.5-pro": "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Expand both sides of the equation:**\n\n* **Left side:** \n   (2x + 1)(3x + 2) = 2x(3x) + 2x(2) + 1(3x) + 1(2) = 6x\u00b2 + 4x + 3x + 2\n* **Right side:**\n   (x - 3)(6x - 5) = x(6x) + x(-5) - 3(6x) - 3(-5) = 6x\u00b2 - 5x - 18x + 15\n\n**Explanation:** We use the distributive property (also known as FOIL) to multiply the binomials.  This ensures we multiply each term in the first binomial by each term in the second.\n\n**2. Combine like terms on both sides:**\n\n* **Left side:** 6x\u00b2 + 4x + 3x + 2 = 6x\u00b2 + 7x + 2\n* **Right side:** 6x\u00b2 - 5x - 18x + 15 = 6x\u00b2 - 23x + 15\n\n**Explanation:**  We simplify each side of the equation by combining the 'x' terms.\n\n**3.  Move all terms to one side:**\n\nTo get a standard quadratic equation (ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0), subtract 6x\u00b2, add 23x, and subtract 15 from both sides:\n\n(6x\u00b2 + 7x + 2) - 6x\u00b2 + 23x - 15 = (6x\u00b2 - 23x + 15) - 6x\u00b2 + 23x - 15\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n30x - 13 = 0\n\n**Explanation:** By moving all terms to one side, we set the equation equal to zero, which is necessary for solving quadratic equations.\n\n**4. Solve for x:**\n\n* Add 13 to both sides: \n   30x = 13\n* Divide both sides by 30: \n   x = 13/30\n\n**Explanation:** We use inverse operations (addition and division) to isolate 'x' and find its value.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe solution to the equation (2x+1)(3x+2) = (x-3)(6x-5) is x = **13/30**. \n"
