        "correct_solution": "In this problem, we're really selecting two separate committees.  We can choose 3 men from the 30 men total in $$ \\binom{30}{3} = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 4,\\!060 $$ways, and 4 women from the 40 women total in $$ \\binom{40}{4} = \\frac{40 \\times 39 \\times 38 \\times 37}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 91,\\!390 $$ways.  Since these two selections are independent (since for each of the $4,\\!060$ ways to pick the men, there are $91,\\!390$ ways to pick the women), we multiply them together to get the number of ways that we can form the 7-member overall committee: $$ \\binom{30}{3}\\binom{40}{4} = (4,\\!060)(91,\\!390) = \\boxed{371,\\!043,\\!400}. $$",

            "gemini-1.5-pro": "Here's how we can break down and solve this problem:\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to find the total number of possible committees.  The key is that the committee has a fixed structure: 3 men out of 30, and 4 women out of 40.  This means we'll be using combinations, not permutations (order doesn't matter).\n\n**Part 1: Selecting the Men**\n\n* **How many ways can we choose 3 men out of 30?**\n   * This is a combination problem denoted as \"30 choose 3\" or  \u2083\u2080C\u2083, calculated as: 30! / (3! * 27!) = 4060 \n   * There are 4060 ways to select the 3 men for the committee.\n\n**Part 2: Selecting the Women**\n\n* **How many ways can we choose 4 women out of 40?**\n   * Similar to the men, this is \"40 choose 4\" or \u2084\u2080C\u2084, calculated as: 40! / (4! * 36!) = 91,390\n   * There are 91,390 ways to select the 4 women.\n\n**Part 3: Combining the Selections**\n\n* **For every group of men, we have a bunch of possible women's groups.** To get the total number of committee combinations, we multiply the number of ways to choose the men by the number of ways to choose the women.\n\n* **Total Committees:** 4060 (ways to choose men) * 91,390 (ways to choose women) = **370,233,400**\n\n**Solution**\n\nThere are **370,233,400** ways to form the 7-person steering committee. \n"
