The height of this arrow can be expressed by the equation $h=10-23t-10t^2$, where $t$ is time in seconds since the arrow was shot. If the center of a target is raised 5 feet off the ground, in how many seconds must the arrow reach the target in order for Billy to hit the bulls eye?",
        "correct_solution": "Since the center of the target is 5 feet above the ground, $h=5$. So we get the quadratic: \\begin{align*}5& =10-23t-10t^{2}\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 0& =10t^{2}+23t-5\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 0&=(2t+5)(5t-1).\n\\end{align*}Thus, the values of $t$ that satisfy the equation are $-\\frac52$ and $\\frac15$. However, since time can never be a negative number, the answer must be $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{5}}$.",

            "gemini-1.5-pro": "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\n* **The Setup:** Billy is shooting an arrow from a height of 10 feet. The arrow's height changes over time according to the equation  h = 10 - 23t - 10t\u00b2, where 'h' is the height and 't' is the time in seconds.\n* **The Goal:** We want to find out when the arrow will hit a target's bullseye, which is 5 feet above the ground.\n\n**2. Set Up the Equation**\n\n* We know the target is at a height of 5 feet. So, we can substitute 'h' with 5 in the equation:\n   5 = 10 - 23t - 10t\u00b2\n\n**3.  Rearrange into a Quadratic Equation**\n\n* To solve for 't', let's rearrange the equation into standard quadratic form (ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0):\n   10t\u00b2 + 23t + 5 = 0\n\n**4. Solve the Quadratic Equation**\n\nWe can solve this using the quadratic formula:\n\n*  t = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n*  Where a = 10, b = 23, and c = 5\n\n*  Substitute the values:\n    t = (-23 \u00b1 \u221a(23\u00b2 - 4 * 10 * 5)) / (2 * 10)\n*  Simplify:\n    t = (-23 \u00b1 \u221a(529 - 200)) / 20\n    t = (-23 \u00b1 \u221a329) / 20\n* Calculate the two possible solutions for 't':\n    t1 = (-23 + \u221a329) / 20 \u2248 -0.21 seconds\n    t2 = (-23 - \u221a329) / 20 \u2248 -2.09 seconds\n\n**5. Choose the Realistic Solution**\n\n* We get two solutions for 't', but time cannot be negative in this scenario.  \n* Therefore, the only realistic solution is t \u2248 -0.21 seconds. However, this answer doesn't make sense in our context either because the arrow cannot hit the target before it is shot. This tells us that, given the arrow's trajectory defined by the equation, it will never actually reach a height of 5 feet.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWhile the math gives us a solution, it's not physically possible for the arrow to hit the bullseye given the provided equation. The arrow's trajectory, as defined by the equation, indicates it will never reach a height of 5 feet. It's possible the equation itself might not accurately represent the arrow's path. \n"
