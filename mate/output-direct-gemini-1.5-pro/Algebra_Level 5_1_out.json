Find the Greatest Common Factor (GCF):**\n\n*  The GCF is the largest number that divides into both 36 and 4 evenly.  The GCF of 36 and 4 is 4.\n\n**2. Factor out the GCF:**\n\n*  We can rewrite the expression as:  \n   $36 - 4x^2 = \\textbf{4}(9 - x^2)$ \n\n**3. Recognize the Difference of Squares:**\n\n* The expression inside the parentheses, $(9 - x^2)$, fits the pattern of the difference of squares: $a^2 - b^2$\n    *  $a^2 = 9  \\Rightarrow  a = 3$\n    *  $b^2 = x^2  \\Rightarrow b = x$\n\n**4. Apply the Difference of Squares Formula:**\n\n* The difference of squares formula states:  $a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)$\n* Applying this to our problem:  $(9 - x^2) = (3 + x)(3 - x)$\n\n**5. Combine for the Complete Solution:**\n\n* Putting everything together, we get the completely factored expression: \n   **$36 - 4x^2 = 4(3 + x)(3 - x)$**\n\n**Therefore, the solution to the problem is 4(3 + x)(3 - x).** \n"
