Our goal is to find the area of the smaller rectangle MBCN, which is located inside the larger rectangle.\n\n**2. Break Down the Problem**\n\n* **Find the dimensions of ABCD:**  We know the area of a rectangle is length times width (Area = length * width). Since the area of ABCD is 40, we need to figure out what two numbers multiply to give us 40. We are given that AM = MB = 4, meaning AB = 8.  Therefore, the width of ABCD is 8. To find the length (AD), we can divide the total area by the width: 40 / 8 = 5.\n\n* **Find the dimensions of MBCN:**  We know MB = 4. We also know NC = 2.  So we have the length and width of rectangle MBCN.\n\n* **Calculate the area of MBCN:** Now that we know the length (MB = 4) and width (NC = 2) of MBCN, we can find its area: 4 * 2 = 8.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe area of rectangle MBCN is **8**. \n"
