Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe problem asks us to find a value for 'n' that satisfies the given congruence. In simpler terms, we need to find a number 'n' such that when 3 times 'n' is divided by 11, the remainder is 2. The answer should be between 0 and 10.\n\n**2. Finding the Modular Inverse**\n\n* To isolate 'n', we need to multiply both sides of the congruence by the modular inverse of 3 (modulo 11).  \n* The modular inverse of 3 (modulo 11) is a number 'a' such that  (3 * a) leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 11.\n* We can find this by checking numbers from 1 to 10. We see that 3 * 4 = 12, which leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 11. \n* Therefore, the modular inverse of 3 (modulo 11) is 4.\n\n**3. Multiplying by the Inverse**\n\n* Multiply both sides of the congruence by 4:\n   \n   ```\n   3n  \u2261  2  (mod 11)\n   4 * (3n)  \u2261  4 * 2  (mod 11) \n   ```\n\n* This simplifies to:\n\n   ```\n   12n  \u2261  8  (mod 11)\n   ```\n\n**4. Simplifying to Find 'n'**\n\n* Since 12 is congruent to 1 modulo 11 (12 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 11), we have:\n\n   ```\n   n  \u2261  8  (mod 11)\n   ```\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTherefore, the solution to the congruence  3n \u2261 2 (mod 11) is **n \u2261 8 (mod 11)**. This means any number that leaves a remainder of 8 when divided by 11 will satisfy the original congruence. \n"
