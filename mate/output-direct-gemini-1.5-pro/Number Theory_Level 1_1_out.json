Understand Prime Numbers**\n\n* **Definition:** A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has only two divisors: 1 and itself. \n* **Examples:** 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37 are all prime numbers less than 40.\n\n**2.  Reasoning for Maximizing the Product**\n\n* To get the greatest product, we want the two prime numbers to be as large as possible. \n\n**3. Identifying the Largest Primes**\n\n* The largest prime number less than 40 is 37.\n* The next largest prime number less than 40 is 31.\n\n**4. Calculating the Product**\n\n* Multiply the two largest prime numbers: 37 * 31 = 1147\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe greatest possible product of any two distinct prime numbers less than 40 is **1147**. \n"
