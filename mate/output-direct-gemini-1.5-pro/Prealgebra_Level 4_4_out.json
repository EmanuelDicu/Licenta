Understand the Problem:**\n\n* We have three circles, one inside the other (concentric).\n* We know the radii of the two larger circles (12 and 13).\n* The area of the ring (the donut-shaped area between the two larger circles) is the same as the area of the smallest circle.\n* We need to find the radius of the smallest circle.\n\n**2. Key Formulas:**\n\n* **Area of a circle:**  Area = \u03c0 * radius\u00b2 \n\n**3. Solve for the Ring's Area:**\n\n* **Area of larger circle:** \u03c0 * 13\u00b2 = 169\u03c0\n* **Area of smaller circle:** \u03c0 * 12\u00b2 = 144\u03c0\n* **Area of the ring:** 169\u03c0 - 144\u03c0 = 25\u03c0\n\n**4. Solve for the Smallest Circle's Radius:**\n\n* We know the area of the smallest circle is also 25\u03c0.\n* **Let 'r' be the radius of the smallest circle.**\n* Using the area formula:  \u03c0 * r\u00b2 = 25\u03c0\n* Divide both sides by \u03c0:  r\u00b2 = 25\n* Take the square root of both sides:  r = 5\n\n**Therefore, the radius of the smallest circle is 5.** \n"
