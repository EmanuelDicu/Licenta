        "correct_solution": "Instead of adding up scores and figuring out the new averages, a quicker way (useful for the countdown round) is as follows:\n\nSince the average is 90, we first calculate how many points below 90 he already is: he's scored 87, 85, and 87, meaning that he is 3, 5, and 3 points below 90 respectively, making for a total of 11 points below.  We then know that his remaining two tests must be a combined 11 points above 90, and since they differ by 3 points, we know that one test is 4 above 90, and the other is 7 above 90, meaning his highest score was $\\boxed{97}$.",

            "gemini-1.5-pro": "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Calculate the total points needed:**\n\n* Ed wants a 90% average on his five tests, which is a total of 90/100 * 500 = 450 points.\n\n**2. Calculate the total points earned on the first three tests:**\n\n* Ed scored 87 + 85 + 87 = 259 points on his first three tests.\n\n**3.  Calculate the total points needed on the last two tests:**\n\n* To achieve his desired average, Ed needs 450 - 259 = 191 points on his last two tests.\n\n**4. Set up an equation to represent the last two test scores:**\n\n* Let 'x' represent the lower score on the last two tests.\n* The higher score is then 'x + 3'.\n* The total points on the last two tests can be represented as: x + (x + 3) = 191\n\n**5. Solve for x:**\n\n* Combine like terms: 2x + 3 = 191\n* Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 188\n* Divide both sides by 2: x = 94\n\n**6. Determine the highest test score:**\n\n* The lower score of the last two tests is 94.\n* The highest score is 94 + 3 = 97\n\n**Solution:** Ed's highest test score was 97. \n"
