        "problem": "A target consists of four concentric circles with radii 4 inches, 6 inches, 8 inches and 10 inches as shown. Given that a dart is thrown that hits the target at a random point, what is the probability that it hits a shaded region? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]size(100); import graph; fill(Circle((0,0),5),gray(.6));\n\nclip(Circle((0,0),2) ^^ Circle((0,0),3) ^^ Circle((0,0),4),fillrule(1));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),2) ^^ Circle((0,0),3) ^^ Circle((0,0),4) ^^ Circle((0,0),5));[/asy]",
        "correct_solution": "The total area of the target is $\\pi\\cdot 10^2=100\\pi$.  The area of the inner shaded region is the area of a circle with radius 4, and that is equal to $\\pi\\cdot 4^2=16\\pi$.  We can calculate the area of the shaded ring as the difference in areas of a circle with radius 8 and with radius 6.  This gives an area of $\\pi \\cdot 8^2 - \\pi \\cdot 6^2 = 28\\pi$.  The total shaded area is $16\\pi+28\\pi=44\\pi$.  The probability a dart will hit a shaded region is equal to $\\frac{44\\pi}{100\\pi}=\\boxed{\\frac{11}{25}}$.",

            "gemini-1.5-pro": "Here's how we can break down this probability problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe have a circular target with four rings. We need to find the probability that a dart landing randomly on this target hits a shaded region.\n\n**2.  Calculate Areas**\n\n* **Area of the whole target:** The largest circle has a radius of 10 inches, so its area is  \u03c0(10)^2 = 100\u03c0 square inches.\n\n* **Area of the largest unshaded circle:** This circle has a radius of 8 inches, so its area is \u03c0(8)^2 = 64\u03c0 square inches.\n\n* **Area of the shaded region:**  Subtract the area of the largest unshaded circle from the area of the whole target: 100\u03c0 - 64\u03c0 = 36\u03c0 square inches.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability**\n\nProbability is calculated as: (Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Possible Outcomes)\n\n* **Favorable Outcomes:** The dart landing in the shaded region (area = 36\u03c0 square inches). \n\n* **Total Possible Outcomes:** The dart landing anywhere within the target (area = 100\u03c0 square inches).\n\n* **Probability:** (36\u03c0) / (100\u03c0) = 36/100 = **9/25**\n\n**Therefore, the probability of the dart hitting a shaded region is 9/25.** \n"
