It asks, \"What angle has a cosine of...?\"\n* **(-1/2):** This is the cosine value we're given. We need to find the angle whose cosine is -1/2. \n* **Radians:** We need to express our answer in radians, not degrees.\n\n**Solving the Problem**\n\n1. **Unit Circle:**  The most reliable way to solve inverse trigonometric problems is to use the unit circle. Recall that on the unit circle:\n    * The x-coordinate of a point on the circle represents the cosine of the corresponding angle.\n    * The y-coordinate represents the sine of the angle.\n\n2. **Finding the Angle:** Look for points on the unit circle where the x-coordinate (cosine) is -1/2.  You'll find two such points:\n\n    * One in the second quadrant.\n    * One in the third quadrant.\n\n3. **Determining the Correct Angle:** Since the cosine function has a range of [-1, 1], it repeats its values.  The arccosine function, however, is defined to have a range of  [0, \u03c0].  This means we only want the angle in the second quadrant.\n\n4. **Radians:** The angle in the second quadrant whose cosine is -1/2 is **2\u03c0/3**.\n\n**Solution**\n\nTherefore, $\\arccos \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}$. \n"
