Each of these digits can be any of the 10 possible numbers.\n\n**Calculations**\n\n* **First digit:** 9 possibilities\n* **Second digit:** 10 possibilities\n* **Third digit:** 10 possibilities\n* ...\n* **Ninth digit:** 10 possibilities\n\nTo find the total number of possible zip codes, we multiply the number of possibilities for each digit:\n\n9 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10  = 9 * 10\u2078 = **900,000,000**\n\n**Solution**\n\nThere are **900,000,000** possible 9-digit zip codes if the first digit cannot be zero. \n"
