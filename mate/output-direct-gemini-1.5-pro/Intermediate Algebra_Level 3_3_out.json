            "gemini-1.5-pro": "Here's a breakdown of the solution, approached step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe're given a complex number *z*.  We know its imaginary part is 164, but we don't know its real part.  Our goal is to find a positive integer *n* that satisfies the given equation.\n\n**2. Represent the Complex Number**\n\nSince we don't know the real part of *z*, let's represent it with the variable *a*. So, we can write *z* as:\n\n*  z =  *a* + 164*i* \n\n**3. Substitute into the Equation**\n\nSubstitute this representation of *z* into the given equation:\n\n*  ( *a* + 164*i* ) / ( *a* + 164*i*  + *n* ) = 4*i*\n\n**4. Simplify the Equation**\n\nOur goal is to isolate *n*.  To do this, let's simplify the equation:\n\n*  Multiply both sides by the denominator of the left side: \n   *a* + 164*i* = 4*i*( *a* + 164*i* + *n* )\n\n*  Expand the right side:\n   *a* + 164*i* = 4*a*i* - 656 + 4*n*i* \n\n**5. Equate Real and Imaginary Parts**\n\nRemember that two complex numbers are equal if and only if their real parts and imaginary parts are equal.  Let's group the terms on the right side:\n\n*  *a* + 164*i*  = (-656) + (4*a* + 4*n*)*i*\n\nNow, equate the real and imaginary parts:\n\n*  Real parts: *a* = -656 \n*  Imaginary parts: 164 = 4*a* + 4*n*\n\n**6. Solve for *n***\n\nWe've already found the value of *a*. Substitute *a* = -656 into the imaginary parts equation:\n\n* 164 = 4*(-656) + 4*n*\n\n* Simplify and solve for *n*:\n* 164 = -2624 + 4*n*\n* 2788 = 4*n*\n* *n* = 697\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe value of *n* is **697**. \n"
