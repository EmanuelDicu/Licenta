Our goal is to find the length of one side of this cube.\n\n**2. Key Idea**\n\nAll edges of a cube have the same length.  Therefore, we can find the side length by calculating the distance between any two adjacent vertices (vertices connected by an edge).\n\n**3. Strategy**\n\n* **Step 1: Determine Adjacent Vertices**  We need to figure out which of the given points P, Q, and R are adjacent. We can do this by looking at their coordinates. Adjacent vertices of a cube will differ in only one coordinate.\n* **Step 2: Calculate Distance** Once we identify two adjacent vertices, we can use the distance formula to find the distance between them, which represents the side length of the cube.\n\n**4. Execution**\n\n* **Step 1: Determine Adjacent Vertices**\n    * Comparing P and Q, we see they differ in all three coordinates (x, y, and z). So, P and Q are not adjacent.\n    * Comparing P and R, they also differ in all three coordinates.  Therefore, P and R are not adjacent.\n    * Comparing Q and R, we see they differ only in their x-coordinate. This means Q and R are adjacent vertices of the cube.\n\n* **Step 2: Calculate Distance**\n    * Now we'll use the distance formula to find the distance between Q (8, 8, 1) and R (11, 3, 9):\n\n     Distance (QR) =  \u221a[(11 - 8)^2 + (3 - 8)^2 + (9 - 1)^2] \n                    = \u221a[3^2 + (-5)^2 + 8^2]\n                    = \u221a(9 + 25 + 64)\n                    = \u221a98\n                    = 7\u221a2\n\n**5. Solution**\n\nThe side length of the cube is **7\u221a2**. \n"
