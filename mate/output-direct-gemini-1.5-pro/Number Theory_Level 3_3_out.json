            "gemini-1.5-pro": "Here's how we can break down this number theory problem:\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\n* **Base Representation:**  When we write numbers, we usually use base-10.  This means each digit represents a power of 10. For example, the number 47 in base-10 means (4 * 10^1) + (7 * 10^0).\n* **Other Bases:** We can use other bases too! In base-$b$, each digit represents a power of $b$.  Our goal is to find the smallest base where 47 can be written with just two digits.\n\n**Solution**\n\n1. **General Form:** A two-digit number in base-$b$ has the form  `ab`  which translates to: \n   (a * b^1) + (b * b^0) = ab + b \n\n2. **Setting up the Equation:** We want to find the smallest  'b' for which:\n   ab + b = 47\n\n3. **Simplifying and Factoring:**\n   * Factor out 'b' on the left side: b(a + 1) = 47\n   * Notice that 47 is a prime number. This means its only factors are 1 and 47.\n\n4. **Finding 'b' and 'a':** Since 'b' represents the base and 'a' represents a digit, 'b' must be greater than 'a'.  Therefore:\n   *  b = 47 \n   *  a + 1 = 1  => a = 0\n\n5. **Verifying:**  If b = 47, our two-digit number in base-47 is 01, which is equal to (0 * 47^1) + (1 * 47^0) = 1. This isn't the correct representation of 47. \n\n6. **Alternative Approach:**  Let's try expressing 47 as one more than a multiple of a smaller base:\n    *  47 = 8 * 6 - 1\n    *  This can be written as: 47 = (1 * 6^1) + (5 * 6^0)\n\n7. **Solution:**  This representation uses two digits in base-6.\n\n**Answer:** The smallest whole number 'b' is **6**. \n"
