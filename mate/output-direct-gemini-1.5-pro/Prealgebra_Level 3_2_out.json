Since the roles are distinct and no one can hold multiple roles, the order in which we choose the people matters. This means we're dealing with a permutation.\n\n**Breaking it Down**\n\n1. **Choosing the President:** We have 8 options for who can be President.\n\n2. **Choosing the Vice-President:** After choosing the President, we only have 7 people left. So, there are 7 options for Vice-President. \n\n3. **Choosing the Treasurer:**  With the President and Vice-President chosen, we have 6 people remaining who could be Treasurer.\n\n**Putting it Together**\n\nTo get the total number of ways to choose all three positions, we multiply the number of possibilities at each step:\n\n8 options (President) * 7 options (Vice-President) * 6 options (Treasurer) = **336**\n\n**Solution**\n\nThere are 336 different ways to choose a President, Vice-President, and Treasurer from a group of 8 people. \n"
