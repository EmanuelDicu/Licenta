            "gemini-1.5-pro": "Here's how to solve this problem by breaking it down:\n\n**1. Recognize the Pattern**\n\nThe problem features an infinite nested radical.  Notice that the expression under the first radical appears again and again:\n\n \u221a( *x + \u221a(x + \u221a(x + ...))* ) \n\nThis repeating pattern is the key to solving the problem.\n\n**2. Substitute for the Infinite Expression**\n\nLet's represent the entire infinite expression with a single variable:\n\nLet  *y* = \u221a( *x + \u221a(x + \u221a(x + ...))* )\n\nSince the expression is infinite, we can substitute the part under the first radical with *y* itself:\n\n *y* = \u221a( *x + y* ) \n\n**3. Solve the Equation**\n\nNow we have a much simpler equation to solve.  Let's do it:\n\n1. **Square both sides:**  *y*\u00b2 = *x + y*\n2. **Rearrange into a quadratic:**  *y*\u00b2 - *y* - *x* = 0\n3. **We know y = 5 (from the problem statement), so substitute:** 5\u00b2 - 5 - *x* = 0\n4. **Simplify and solve for x:** 25 - 5 - *x* = 0  -->  20 - *x* = 0  -->  *x* = 20\n\n**Solution**\nThe value of *x* for which the given expression equals 5 is **x = 20**. \n"
