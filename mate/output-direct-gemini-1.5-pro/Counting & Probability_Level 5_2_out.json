            "gemini-1.5-pro": "##  Counting Squares in a Grid\n\nTo solve this problem, we'll break it down into manageable steps based on the size of the squares:\n\n**1. Identify Square Sizes**\n\nWe can have squares of side length 1, 2, 3, and 4 within the 5x5 grid. \n\n**2. Count Squares of Each Size**\n\n* **1x1 Squares:**  These are the simplest.  Each dot in the 4x4 grid formed by the inner dots of the 5x5 grid can be the top-left corner of a 1x1 square.  So, there are **16** (4x4) squares of size 1x1.\n\n* **2x2 Squares:** Each dot in the 3x3 grid formed by the inner dots of the 5x5 grid can be the top-left corner of a 2x2 square.  So, there are **9** (3x3) squares of size 2x2.\n\n* **3x3 Squares:** Each dot in the 2x2 grid formed by the inner dots of the 5x5 grid can be the top-left corner of a 3x3 square. So, there are **4** (2x2) squares of size 3x3.\n\n* **4x4 Squares:** There's only **1** possible 4x4 square that uses all the outer dots of the 5x5 grid.\n\n**3. Total Squares**\n\nFinally, add up the number of squares of each size: 16 + 9 + 4 + 1 = **30**\n\n**Therefore, there are a total of 30 squares in the 5x5 grid.** \n"
