        "correct_solution": "There are $5!$ ways to arrange 5 beads in a line.  Since there are 5 rotations in a circle for each of these arrangements, we must divide by 5, and since there are two matching reflections for each arrangement, we must divide by 2.  So there are $\\dfrac{5!}{5 \\times 2} = \\boxed{12}$ ways.",

            "gemini-1.5-pro": "Here's how to solve this circular permutation problem:\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nImagine a bracelet as a circle. We need to arrange 5 distinct beads on this circle. The key here is that rotating the bracelet or flipping it over doesn't create a new arrangement.  \n\n**Breaking Down the Solution**\n\n1. **Linear Permutations:** Let's first consider how many ways we can arrange the beads if it were a straight line instead of a circle.  We have 5 choices for the first bead, 4 choices for the second, and so on. This gives us 5! (5 factorial) linear arrangements:\n\n   5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n\n2. **Accounting for Rotations:** Now, imagine we take one of these linear arrangements and connect the ends to form a bracelet.  We can rotate this bracelet to get arrangements that would have been distinct in a linear arrangement but are considered the same for a bracelet. For example, if the beads in a linear arrangement are ABCDE, the following circular arrangements are all equivalent:\n\n   * ABCDE\n   * BCDEA\n   * CDEAB\n   * DEABC\n   * EABCD\n\n   Since there are 5 positions on the bracelet, we've overcounted by a factor of 5.\n\n3. **Accounting for Flips:**  Furthermore, we can flip the bracelet over to get another arrangement that is considered the same. For example:\n\n   * ABCDE (original) \n   * EDCBA (flipped)\n\n   This means we've overcounted by another factor of 2.\n\n**The Final Calculation**\n\nTo get the correct number of arrangements for the bracelet, we need to divide the number of linear arrangements by the overcounting factors:\n\nTotal arrangements = (Linear arrangements) / (Rotations) / (Flips)\n\nTotal arrangements = 120 / 5 / 2 = **12**\n\n**Therefore, there are 12 distinct ways to arrange 5 different beads on a bracelet when rotations and flips are not considered different.** \n"
