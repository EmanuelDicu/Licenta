Students Who Play a Sport:**\n\n* **Problem:** We know some students play *neither* sport.  We need to find out how many students play *at least* one sport.\n* **Solution:** \n    * Start with the total number of students: 50\n    * Subtract the number who play neither sport: 50 - 8 = 42 students\n\n**2. Combined Participants (Potentially Overlapping):**\n\n* **Problem:**  The numbers for hockey and baseball individually add up to more than the number who play *at least* one sport. This tells us some students are counted twice.\n* **Solution:**\n    * Add the number of hockey players and baseball players: 33 + 24 = 57\n\n**3. Finding the Overlap (Students Playing Both):**\n\n* **Problem:** The difference between the combined number and the number who play at least one sport will tell us how many students are counted twice (meaning they play both sports).\n* **Solution:**\n    * Subtract the number playing at least one sport from the combined total: 57 - 42 = 15 students\n\n**Answer:** 15 students played both hockey and baseball. \n"
