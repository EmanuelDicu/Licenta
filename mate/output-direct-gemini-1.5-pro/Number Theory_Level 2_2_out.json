            "gemini-1.5-pro": "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe need to find two-digit multiples of 7.  This means numbers you can get by multiplying 7 by another whole number, and the result must be between 10 and 99. Then, we need to check the digits of those multiples. If the digits add up to 10, we've found one of the numbers we're looking for. Finally, we need to add those two special multiples of 7 together.\n\n**2. List the Two-Digit Multiples of 7**\n\nLet's list out the two-digit multiples of 7:\n\n* 7 x 2 = 14\n* 7 x 3 = 21\n* 7 x 4 = 28\n* 7 x 5 = 35\n* 7 x 6 = 42\n* 7 x 7 = 49\n* 7 x 8 = 56\n* 7 x 9 = 63\n* 7 x 10 = 70\n* 7 x 11 = 77\n* 7 x 12 = 84\n* 7 x 13 = 91\n* 7 x 14 = 98 \n\n**3. Identify Multiples with a Digit Sum of 10**\n\nNow, let's check which of these multiples have digits that add up to 10:\n\n* 14 (1 + 4 = 5)\n* 21 (2 + 1 = 3)\n* 28 (2 + 8 = 10)  <-- Found one!\n* 35 (3 + 5 = 8)\n* 42 (4 + 2 = 6)\n* 49 (4 + 9 = 13)\n* 56 (5 + 6 = 11)\n* 63 (6 + 3 = 9)\n* 70 (7 + 0 = 7)\n* 77 (7 + 7 = 14)\n* 84 (8 + 4 = 12)\n* 91 (9 + 1 = 10)  <-- Found the second one!\n* 98 (9 + 8 = 17)\n\n**4. Calculate the Sum**\n\nWe found two multiples of 7 whose digits add up to 10: 28 and 91.  Finally, we add these two numbers:\n\n* 28 + 91 = 119\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe sum of the two two-digit multiples of 7 whose digits add up to 10 is **119**. \n"
