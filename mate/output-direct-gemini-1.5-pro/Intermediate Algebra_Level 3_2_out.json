Substitute this into the real part equation:\n   a + \u221a(a\u00b2 + 8\u00b2) = 2\n   \u221a(a\u00b2 + 64) = 2 - a \n   Square both sides: a\u00b2 + 64 = 4 - 4a + a\u00b2\n   Simplify and solve for 'a': 4a = -60  => a = -15\n\n7. **Form the complex number:**\n   We found a = -15 and b = 8.  Therefore:\n   z = a + bi = -15 + 8i\n\n**Solution**\nThe complex number *z* that satisfies the given equation is **z = -15 + 8i**. \n"
