Our goal is to find the smallest positive value of  'x' that makes all five cosine values non-positive (less than or equal to zero).\n\n**Breaking Down the Solution**\n\n1. **Cosine and the Unit Circle:** Remember that the cosine of an angle is represented by the x-coordinate of a point on the unit circle.  Cosine is negative in the second and third quadrants of the unit circle.\n\n   [Insert image of unit circle highlighting the 2nd and 3rd quadrants where cosine is negative]\n\n2. **Multiples of  2\u03c0x:** The angles inside the cosine functions (2\u03c0x, 4\u03c0x, 8\u03c0x, 16\u03c0x, 32\u03c0x) are all multiples of 2\u03c0x. This means as x increases, we're essentially rotating around the unit circle multiple times.\n\n3. **Finding the Right Quadrant:**  We need to find a value of 'x' that places all five angles within the second or third quadrants (where cosine is non-positive). \n\n**Solving the Problem**\n\n* **First Angle (2\u03c0x):**  Let's start by focusing on the smallest angle, 2\u03c0x. To be in the second quadrant, this angle needs to fall within the range:\n   \u03c0/2 < 2\u03c0x < \u03c0\n\n* **Simplifying the Inequality:** Dividing all parts of the inequality by 2\u03c0, we get:\n    1/4 < x < 1/2 \n\n* **Checking Other Multiples:** Now, let's see if this range of 'x' works for the other angles. If 'x' is between 1/4 and 1/2:\n    * 4\u03c0x will be between \u03c0 and 2\u03c0 (third quadrant - cosine is negative)\n    * 8\u03c0x will be between 2\u03c0 and 4\u03c0 (third/fourth quadrant, but cosine is negative for part of this range) \n    * 16\u03c0x will be between 4\u03c0 and 8\u03c0 (similar to 8\u03c0x)\n    * 32\u03c0x will be between 8\u03c0 and 16\u03c0 (similar to 8\u03c0x and 16\u03c0x)\n\n* **Finding the Smallest x:** We need to ensure all five angles fall within the negative cosine regions.  Notice that as the multiples of 'x' increase, we cover more of the unit circle.  The key is to find the smallest value of 'x' within our range (1/4 < x < 1/2) that works for all five angles. \n\n* **Testing Values:** Let's test a value slightly larger than 1/4.  If we choose x = 3/10:\n    * 2\u03c0x = 3\u03c0/5  (second quadrant)\n    * 4\u03c0x = 6\u03c0/5  (third quadrant)\n    * 8\u03c0x = 12\u03c0/5 (third quadrant)\n    * 16\u03c0x = 24\u03c0/5 (third quadrant)\n    * 32\u03c0x = 48\u03c0/5 (third quadrant)\n\n    All five angles land in the second or third quadrant, making all five cosine values non-positive.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe smallest possible positive value of 'x' that satisfies the given conditions is **x = 3/10**. \n"
