        "problem": "In Mathopolis, an adult is a person 21 years of age or older and a child is a person under 21 years of age.  Exactly half of the  adults in Mathopolis are female, and exactly half of the female  adults have exactly one biological child.  Nobody else has a  child, and there are no other children.  What percent of the  people of Mathopolis are children?",
        "correct_solution": "Let the percentage of people in Mathopolis who are children be $x$. The percentage of adults is then $1-x$. Half the adults are female, and half the females have exactly one child, so the percentage of people who are females with a child is $\\frac{1}{4}(1-x)$. This percentage is equal to the percentage of children, since there is a correspondence between a mother and a child. So we have the equation $x=\\frac{1}{4}(1-x)$. Solving for $x$ yields $x=1/5$, or $\\boxed{20}$ percent.",

            "gemini-1.5-pro": "Here's how we can break down this problem:\n\n**1. Focus on the Key Information**\n\n* **Adults:** 21 years or older\n* **Children:** Under 21 years old\n* **Female Adults:** Represent half of the total adult population.\n* **Mothers (Female Adults with One Child):** Represent half of the female adult population.\n\n**2.  Establish Relationships**\n\n* **Mothers to Children:** There's a 1:1 relationship. For every mother, there's one child.\n\n**3.  Use Logic to Determine Proportions**\n\n* **Mothers represent half the female adult population:**  This means that for every 4 adults in Mathopolis (let's assume this number for easier calculation), 2 are female.\n* **Mothers represent half of that:** Out of those 2 female adults, only 1 is a mother.\n* **Children equal mothers:** Since there's one child per mother, there's 1 child in our group of 4 people.\n\n**4. Calculate the Percentage**\n\n* **Children to Total Population:** In our group of 4 people, 1 is a child. This represents 1/4 or 25%.\n\n**Solution:** 25% of the people in Mathopolis are children. \n"
