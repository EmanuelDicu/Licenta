        "correct_solution": "If $a_n =an + b$ and $b_n = cn + d$ are two arithmetic sequences, then their term-wise product takes the form \\[a_nb_n = (an+b)(cn+d) = An^2 + Bn + C,\\]where $A, B, C$ are constants. Therefore, some sequence $x_n = An^2 + Bn + C$ has $x_0 = 1440,$ $x_1 = 1716,$ and $x_2 = 1848.$ Then we have the equations \\[\\begin{aligned} C &= 1440, \\\\ A+B+C&=1716,\\\\  4A+2B+C&=1848. \\end{aligned}\\]Subtracting $C=1440$ from the second and third equations, we have $A+B=276$ and $4A+2B=408,$ or $2A+B=204.$ Then \\[A = (2A+B) - (A+B) = 204 - 276 = -72,\\]and so $B = 276-A=348.$ We conclude that the given sequence has the general formula \\[x_n = -72n^2 + 348n + 1440.\\]Then the eighth term is \\[\\begin{aligned} x_7 &= -72 \\cdot 7^2 + 348 \\cdot 7 + 1440 = \\boxed{348}. \\end{aligned}\\]",

To find the eighth term, we need to:\n\n1. **Identify the two arithmetic sequences.**\n2. **Find the formulas for the nth term of each sequence.**\n3. **Multiply the formulas to get a formula for the nth term of the combined sequence.**\n4. **Calculate the eighth term using the formula.**\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n**1. Identifying the Arithmetic Sequences:**\n\nSince the given sequence is formed by multiplying terms of two arithmetic sequences, let's look for a common factor between consecutive terms. \n\n* Notice that 1440, 1716, and 1848 are all divisible by 12. \n\nDividing each term by 12, we get: 120, 143, 154, ... \n\nLet's see if this new sequence provides any clues. Observe that the differences between consecutive terms are:\n\n* 143 - 120 = 23\n* 154 - 143 = 11\n\nThis suggests our two arithmetic sequences could be:\n\n* **Sequence 1:** 12, ...  (We'll figure out the common difference)\n* **Sequence 2:** 120, 143, 154, ... (Common difference of 11)\n\nTo confirm the first sequence's common difference, let's assume the second term is obtained by multiplying the second terms of our two potential arithmetic sequences. \n\nLet the second term of Sequence 1 be 'x'. Then:\n\n* 12 * x = 1716 \n* x = 143\n\nThis confirms our two arithmetic sequences are:\n\n* **Sequence 1:** 12, 143, ... (Common difference of 131)\n* **Sequence 2:** 120, 143, 154, ... (Common difference of 11)\n\n**2. Formulas for the nth term:**\n\nRecall the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\n* a<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>1</sub> + (n-1)d\n\nWhere:\n* a<sub>n</sub> = nth term\n* a<sub>1</sub> = first term\n* d = common difference\n\nUsing this, we get the formulas for our sequences:\n\n* **Sequence 1:** a<sub>n</sub> = 12 + (n-1)131 = 131n - 119\n* **Sequence 2:** a<sub>n</sub> = 120 + (n-1)11 = 11n + 109\n\n**3. Formula for the Combined Sequence:**\n\nThe nth term of the combined sequence is found by multiplying the nth terms of our two arithmetic sequences:\n\n* Combined a<sub>n</sub> = (131n - 119)(11n + 109)\n\n**4. Calculating the Eighth Term:**\n\nSubstitute n = 8 into the combined formula:\n\n* Combined a<sub>8</sub> = (131*8 - 119)(11*8 + 109)\n* Combined a<sub>8</sub> = (939)(197) \n* Combined a<sub>8</sub> = 185083\n\n**Solution:** The eighth term of the sequence is 185,083. \n"
