            "gemini-1.5-pro": "Let's break down this geometry problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Setup**\n\n* **Sphere Inscribed in a Cube:**  Imagine a cube with a sphere perfectly contained inside it, touching all six faces of the cube.\n* **Key Relationship:** The diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube.\n\n**2. Using the Volume Formula**\n\n* **Volume of a Sphere:**  The volume (V) of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where r is the radius of the sphere. \n\n**3. Finding the Sphere's Radius**\n\n* **Given Information:** We know the volume of the sphere is \u03c0/6 cubic inches.  Let's plug this into the volume formula and solve for the radius (r):\n   * \u03c0/6 = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3\n   * 1/6 = (4/3)r\u00b3 \n   * 1/8 = r\u00b3\n   * r = 1/2 inch\n\n**4. Finding the Cube's Side Length**\n\n* **Diameter = Side Length:** Since the diameter of the sphere is twice the radius, the diameter is 1 inch. This is also the side length (s) of the cube.\n\n**5. Calculating the Cube's Volume**\n\n* **Volume of a Cube:** The volume (V) of a cube is given by the formula V = s\u00b3.\n* **Calculation:** With s = 1 inch, the volume of the cube is:\n   * V = 1\u00b3 = 1 cubic inch\n\n**Solution:** The volume of the cube is **1 cubic inch**. \n"
