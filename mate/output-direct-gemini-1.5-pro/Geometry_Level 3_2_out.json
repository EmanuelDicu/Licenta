            "gemini-1.5-pro": "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe are given a triangle with a special line segment called an altitude.  An altitude is a line segment drawn from a vertex of a triangle perpendicular to the opposite side.  We need to find the perimeter, which is the total length of all the sides of the triangle.\n\n**Solution**\n\n**Part 1: Recognizing Right Triangles**\n\n* Since AK is an altitude, we know that \u2220AKB and \u2220AKC are right angles.\n* This means we have two right triangles within our larger triangle: \u0394AKB and \u0394AKC.\n\n**Part 2: Using the Pythagorean Theorem**\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the missing side lengths in each of our right triangles:\n\n* **In \u0394AKB:**\n    *  AB\u00b2 = AK\u00b2 + BK\u00b2\n    *  AB\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 + 8\u00b2 \n    *  AB\u00b2 = 100\n    *  AB = 10 \n* **In \u0394AKC:**\n    * AC\u00b2 = AK\u00b2 + CK\u00b2\n    * AC\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 + 6\u00b2\n    * AC\u00b2 = 72\n    * AC = \u221a72 = 6\u221a2\n\n**Part 3: Calculating the Perimeter**\n\n* Now we have all the sides of \u0394ABC: AB = 10, BC = BK + CK = 8 + 6 = 14, and AC = 6\u221a2. \n* Perimeter = AB + BC + AC = 10 + 14 + 6\u221a2 = 24 + 6\u221a2\n\n**Answer**\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle is **24 + 6\u221a2**. \n"
