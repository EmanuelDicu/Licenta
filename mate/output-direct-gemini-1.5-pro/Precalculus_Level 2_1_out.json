In other words:\n\n  *  sin(x) = cos(90\u00b0 - x) \n\nWe can use this identity to rewrite our equation in terms of either sine or cosine.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the complementary angle identity.**\n\nLet's rewrite the equation using the identity above:\n\n*  Since we have cos(7\u03b8), we want to find an angle whose cosine is equal to sin(3\u03b8). \n* Using our identity,  sin(3\u03b8) = cos(90\u00b0 - 3\u03b8)\n\nNow we can rewrite our original equation as:\n\n * cos(90\u00b0 - 3\u03b8) = cos(7\u03b8)\n\n**Step 3: Solve for the angles.**\n\nWhen two cosine functions are equal, their arguments (the angles inside the cosine function) must differ by a multiple of 360\u00b0. This means:\n\n * 90\u00b0 - 3\u03b8 = 7\u03b8 + 360\u00b0k  (where k is an integer)\n\n**Step 4: Solve the linear equation.**\n\nNow we have a simple linear equation. Let's solve for \u03b8:\n\n1. Combine like terms: 10\u03b8 = -270\u00b0 + 360\u00b0k\n2. Divide both sides by 10:  \u03b8 = -27\u00b0 + 36\u00b0k\n\n**Step 5: Find the smallest positive solution.**\n\nTo find the smallest positive angle, we'll start with k = 0 and substitute into our equation:\n\n* \u03b8 = -27\u00b0 + 36\u00b0(0) = -27\u00b0\n\nThis is negative, so we'll increase k to 1:\n\n* \u03b8 = -27\u00b0 + 36\u00b0(1) = 9\u00b0\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe smallest positive angle \u03b8 for which sin 3\u03b8 = cos 7\u03b8 is **9\u00b0**. \n"
