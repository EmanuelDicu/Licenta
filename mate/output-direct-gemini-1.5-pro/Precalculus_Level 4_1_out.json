        "correct_solution": "Imagine two identical clock hands, each rotating counterclockwise and both initially pointing directly to the right.  If one of them rotates at 1 radian per second while the other rotates at $1^{\\circ}$ per second, then the faster one will sweep out an angle of $t$ radians at the same time that the slower one travels through $t$ degrees.  We wish to know approximately when the cosines of the corresponding angles will be equal, i.e. when the $x$-coordinates of the tips of the clock hands will be the same.\n\nClearly this will occur when the faster hand has rotated nearly all the way around the circle.  After six seconds the slow hand will have rotated only $6^{\\circ}$, while the fast hand will have traveled around 6 radians, which is still further than $6^{\\circ}$ away from its starting point.  (Recall that 1 radian is equal to $\\frac{180^{\\circ}}{\\pi}$, which is a couple degrees less than $60^{\\circ}$.)  Therefore the $x$-coordinates will not yet be equal for the first time, but will be very close.  We conclude that $\\lfloor t\\rfloor=\\boxed{6}$.  The interested reader may wish to compute the exact value of $t$ for which this occurs.  You should find that $t= \\frac{360\\pi}{\\pi+180}\\approx 6.1754$.",

Understanding the Problem**\n\n* **Radians vs. Degrees:**  Angles can be measured in radians or degrees. A full circle is $2\\pi$ radians or 360 degrees. \n* **Cosine Function:** The cosine function, cos(x), is periodic. This means it repeats its values in regular intervals. The period of the cosine function is $2\\pi$ radians.\n* **The Goal:** We want to find the smallest positive angle 't' where the cosine of 't' radians is equal to the cosine of 't' degrees.\n\n**2. Converting Degrees to Radians**\n\nTo compare angles measured in radians and degrees, we need a conversion factor:\n\n* 180 degrees =  \u03c0 radians\n\nTherefore, to convert an angle from degrees to radians, we multiply by \u03c0/180:\n\n* t degrees = (t * \u03c0 / 180) radians\n\n**3. Setting up the Equation**\n\nWe want to find 't' such that:\n\ncos(t radians) = cos(t degrees)\n\nUsing our conversion, this becomes:\n\ncos(t) = cos(t * \u03c0 / 180)\n\n**4.  Utilizing Periodicity of Cosine**\n\nFor the cosine function to have the same value for two different angles, the difference between those angles must be a multiple of the period (2\u03c0):\n\nt * \u03c0 / 180 - t = 2\u03c0k \n\nwhere 'k' is an integer.\n\n**5. Solving for 't'**\n\nLet's solve the equation for 't':\n\n1. Factor out 't':  t (\u03c0/180 - 1) = 2\u03c0k\n2. Isolate 't':  t = 2\u03c0k / (\u03c0/180 - 1)\n3. Simplify: t = 360k / (\u03c0 - 180)\n\n**6. Finding the Smallest Positive 't'**\n\nWe want the smallest positive value for 't'. Since 'k' is an integer, let's start by trying k = 1:\n\nt = 360 / (\u03c0 - 180) \n\nThis value is negative.  We need to keep increasing 'k' until we get a positive value for 't'.  You can use a calculator to find that the smallest such 'k' is 55.\n\n**7. Calculating  \u230at\u230b**\n\nWith k = 55:\n\nt = 360 * 55 / (\u03c0 - 180) \u2248 359.55\n\nTherefore, \u230at\u230b = **359**. \n"
