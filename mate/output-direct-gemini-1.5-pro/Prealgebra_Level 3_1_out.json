Simplify both sides of the equation:**\n\n* **Distribute the 4 on the left side:** \n   5x - 3x + 4(1 - 4x) = 32  \n   becomes: 5x - 3x + 4 - 16x = 32\n\n* **Combine like terms on the left side:**\n   (5x - 3x - 16x) + 4 = 32\n   becomes: -14x + 4 = 32\n\n**2. Isolate the x term:**\n\n* **Subtract 4 from both sides:**\n   -14x + 4 - 4 = 32 - 4\n   becomes: -14x = 28\n\n**3. Solve for x:**\n\n* **Divide both sides by -14:**\n   -14x / -14 = 28 / -14\n   becomes: x = -2\n\n**Therefore, the solution to the equation 5x - 3x + 4(1 - 4x) = 32 is x = -2.** \n"
