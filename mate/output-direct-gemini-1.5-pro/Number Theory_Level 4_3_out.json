        "correct_solution": "First, we need to multiply the units digit: $5_6 \\times 4_6 = 20_{10} = 32_6$. Hence, we write down a $2$ and carry-over the $3$. Evaluating the next digit, we need to multiply $1_6 \\times 4_6 + 3_6 = 7_{10} = 11_{6}$. Thus, the next digit is a $1$ and $1$ is carried over. Finally, the leftmost digits are given by $3_6 \\times 4_6 + 1_6 = 13_{10} = 21_6$. Writing this out:  $$\\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & & & \\stackrel{1}{3} & \\stackrel{3}{1} & \\stackrel{}{5}_6 \\\\\n& & & \\times & & & 4_6 \\\\\n\\cline{4-7} & & & 2 & 1 & 1 & 2_6 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{2112_6}$.",

Place values in base 6 are powers of 6, so:\n\n*  ... 6\u2074, 6\u00b3, 6\u00b2, 6\u00b9, 6\u2070 \n\n**Step 1: Convert to Base 10**\n\nIt's often easier to perform multiplication in base 10, so let's convert our numbers:\n\n*  $315_6 = (3 \\cdot 6^2) + (1 \\cdot 6^1) + (5 \\cdot 6^0) = 108 + 6 + 5 = 119_{10}$\n*  $4_6 = (4 \\cdot 6^0) = 4_{10}$\n\n**Step 2: Multiply in Base 10**\n\nNow we have a simple multiplication problem:\n\n*  $119_{10} \\cdot 4_{10} = 476_{10}$\n\n**Step 3: Convert the Result Back to Base 6**\n\nTo convert 476 back to base 6, we find the largest power of 6 that goes into 476:\n\n*  The largest power of 6 that fits into 476 is 6\u00b2 (which is 36), and it fits 13 times (13 x 36 = 468). \n*  This leaves us with 476 - 468 = 8.\n*  The largest power of 6 that fits into 8 is 6\u00b9 (which is 6), and it fits 1 time (1 x 6 = 6).\n*  This leaves us with 8 - 6 = 2. \n*  Therefore,  $476_{10} = (13 \\cdot 6^2) + (1 \\cdot 6^1) + (2 \\cdot 6^0)$.\n\n**Step 4: Express the Answer in Base 6**\n\nSince we can't have a '13' in base 6, we need to adjust:\n\n*  13 in base 6 is represented as $21_6$ (because 13 is two groups of 6 plus 1).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{2112_6}$ \n"
