        "correct_solution": "The only way for the Dora to end up at her starting point in four steps is for her to traverse the four sides of the gray square.  She can do this in two ways: clockwise and counterclockwise. The probability of each of these two paths is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^4=\\frac{1}{256}$.  Therefore, the probability that she ends up where she started is $\\dfrac{1}{256}+\\dfrac{1}{256}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{128}}$.",
