Since the pyramid is a right pyramid, segment $\\overline{PF}$ is an altitude of triangle $PBD$.  Since $PBD$ is an equilateral triangle with side length 6, $PFB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle with $FB = BD/2 =3$ and $PF = 3\\sqrt{3}$.  Finally, $\\overline{BD}$ is a diagonal of square base $ABCD$, so we have $BC = BD/\\sqrt{2} = 6/\\sqrt{2} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the volume of the pyramid is \\[\\frac{[ABCD](PF)}{3} = \\frac{(3\\sqrt{2})^2 (3\\sqrt{3})}{3} = \\boxed{18\\sqrt{3}}.\\]",

Because PBD is an equilateral triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem on it to get h^2 + 3^2 = 6^2.  Solving for h, we get h = \\sqrt{27} = 3\\sqrt{3}.\nStep 4:\nBecause the area of the base ABCD is equal to the square of the height of the equilateral triangle PBD, the area of the base ABCD is (3\\sqrt{3})^2 = 27.\nStep 5:\nThe volume of the pyramid PABCD is (1/3) * (area of the base ABCD) * (height of the pyramid), and the height of the pyramid is also h, because PBD is a height of the pyramid.  Therefore, the volume of the pyramid is (1/3) * 27 * 3\\sqrt{3} = 9\\sqrt{3}.\nStep 6:\nTherefore, the volume of the pyramid PABCD is 9\\sqrt{3}.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{9\\sqrt{3}}\n\"\"\""
