        "correct_solution": "Instead of adding up scores and figuring out the new averages, a quicker way (useful for the countdown round) is as follows:\n\nSince the average is 90, we first calculate how many points below 90 he already is: he's scored 87, 85, and 87, meaning that he is 3, 5, and 3 points below 90 respectively, making for a total of 11 points below.  We then know that his remaining two tests must be a combined 11 points above 90, and since they differ by 3 points, we know that one test is 4 above 90, and the other is 7 above 90, meaning his highest score was $\\boxed{97}$.",

            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Here is the solution:\n\nStep 1:\nLet $x$ be the score of the fourth test and $x + 3$ be the score of the fifth test.\n\nStep 2:\nThe sum of the scores of all five tests is $87 + 85 + 87 + x + (x + 3)$.\n\nStep 3:\nThe average score of the five tests is $90\\%$ of $100$, which is $0.9 \\cdot 100 = 90$.\n\nStep 4:\nSince the average score is $90$, the sum of the scores of all five tests is $5 \\cdot 90 = 450$.\n\nStep 5:\nWe can set up an equation: $87 + 85 + 87 + x + (x + 3) = 450$.\n\nStep 6:\nSimplify the equation: $259 + 2x + 3 = 450$.\n\nStep 7:\nSubtract $259$ and $3$ from both sides: $2x = 188$.\n\nStep 8:\nDivide both sides by $2$: $x = 94$.\n\nStep 9:\nSince the score of the fifth test is $x + 3$, the score of the fifth test is $94 + 3 = 97$.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{97}"
