Let's calculate the digit sum for each of the numbers listed in Step 1: \n14 (1+4=5), 21 (2+1=3), 28 (2+8=10), 35 (3+5=8), 42 (4+2=6), 49 (4+9=13), 56 (5+6=11), 63 (6+3=9), 70 (7+0=7), 77 (7+7=14), 84 (8+4=12), 91 (9+1=10), 98 (9+8=17).\n\nStep 3:\nFrom the list, we can see that only 28 and 91 have a digit sum of 10, which satisfies the condition.\n\nStep 4:\nThe problem asks for the sum of these two multiples, so we add 28 and 91 to get 119.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{119}"
