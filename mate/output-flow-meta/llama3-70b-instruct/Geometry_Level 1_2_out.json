Therefore, the angle formed at vertex $B$ is also 124 degrees.\n\nStep 3:\nThe sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. We can set up an equation to represent this: $124 + x + 124 = 180$.\n\nStep 4:\nSimplify the equation: $248 + x = 180$.\n\nStep 5:\nSubtract 248 from both sides of the equation: $x = 180 - 248 = -68$.\n\nStep 6:\nSince the measure of an angle cannot be negative, we take the absolute value: $x = |-68| = 68$.\n\nFinal answer:\n$\\boxed{68^{\\circ}}$"
