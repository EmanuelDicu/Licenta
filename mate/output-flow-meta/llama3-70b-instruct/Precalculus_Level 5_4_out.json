Then, we have $|OA| = |OB| = |OC| = s$.\nStep 3:\nSince $a, b, c$ are vertices of a square, they form a right triangle with sides of lengths $s$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we get $|OC|^2 = |OA|^2 + |AC|^2$, which implies $s^2 = s^2 + |AC|^2$. Therefore, $|AC| = 0$.\nStep 4:\nSince $AC$ is a side of the square, $|AC| = s$. Thus, $s = 0$, which implies $a = b = c = 0$.\nStep 5:\nSubstituting the values of $a, b, c$ into the given expression, we get \\[\\frac{ac + b^2}{ab} = \\frac{0}{0}.\\]\nStep 6:\nHowever, since $a, b, c$ are not distinct points, the problem statement is invalid.
