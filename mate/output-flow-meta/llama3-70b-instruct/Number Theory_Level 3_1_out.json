Since 11 is a prime number, we can use the property that if ab \u2261 ac (mod p), then b \u2261 c (mod p), where p is a prime number.\n\nStep 3:\nWe can multiply both sides of the congruence equation by 4, which is the modular inverse of 3 modulo 11, to get 12n \u2261 8 (mod 11).\n\nStep 4:\nSince 12 \u2261 1 (mod 11), the equation simplifies to n \u2261 8 (mod 11).\n\nStep 5:\nTherefore, the value of n that satisfies the congruence equation is 8.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{8}"
