        "correct_solution": "The best way to do this is to find the probability that the two E's are next to each other.  There are $\\dfrac{7!}{2}$ arrangements of the word SIXTEEN.  If we want to find the number of arrangements such that the E's are next to each other, we find the number of arrangements of the six-letter word SIXT(EE)N (where we treat the two E's as a block), which is $6!$.  So the probability that an arrangement of the word SIXTEEN has the two E's next to each other is $\\dfrac{6!}{\\frac{7!}{2}} = \\dfrac{2}{7}$.  So the probability that the two E's aren't next to each other is $1 - \\dfrac{2}{7} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{7}}$.",

            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Here is the solution:\n\nStep 1:\nThe word `SIXTEEN' has 8 letters in total.\nStep 2:\nWe want to find the total number of arrangements of the letters, which is 8! (8 factorial) = 40320, since there are 8 letters and they are arranged randomly.\nStep 3:\nNow, let's consider the case where the two E's are next to each other.  We can treat them as one unit, which gives us 7 units (6 letters and the EE unit) to arrange.  This can be done in 7! ways.  However, the EE unit can be arranged in 2 ways (EE or EE), so the total number of arrangements with the E's next to each other is 2 * 7! = 2 * 5040 = 10080.\nStep 4:\nThe probability that the two E's are next to each other is the number of arrangements with the E's next to each other divided by the total number of arrangements, which is 10080 / 40320 = 1/4.\nStep 5:\nThe probability that the two E's are not next to each other is 1 minus the probability that they are next to each other, so it is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}"
