            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Here is the solution:\n\nStep 1:\nThe sphere is inscribed in a cube, which means the diameter of the sphere is equal to the length of a side of the cube.\n\nStep 2:\nThe volume of a sphere is given by the formula $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere.\n\nStep 3:\nGiven that the volume of the sphere is $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$ cubic inches, we can set up the equation $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ and solve for $r$.\n\nStep 4:\nSimplifying the equation, we get $4r^3 = \\frac{1}{2}$, so $r = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nStep 5:\nSince the diameter of the sphere is equal to the length of a side of the cube, and the radius is half the diameter, the length of a side of the cube is 1 inch.\n\nStep 6:\nThe volume of a cube is given by the formula $V = s^3$, where $s$ is the length of a side of the cube. In this case, $V = 1^3 = 1$ cubic inch.\n\nStep 7:\nSince the cube has 6 faces, and each face has an area of 1 square inch, the volume of the cube is 6 times the area of one face, which is 6 cubic inches.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{6}"
