It returns the angle in radians whose cosine is the given input value.\n\nStep 3:\nWe know that the cosine of \u03c0/3 radians is 1/2, and since the input value is -1/2, we need to find the angle whose cosine is -1/2.\n\nStep 4:\nThe cosine function is negative in the second and third quadrants. The reference angle for \u03c0/3 radians is \u03c0/3 radians itself, and its cosine is 1/2. Therefore, the angle in the second quadrant whose cosine is -1/2 is \u03c0 - \u03c0/3 = 2\u03c0/3 radians.\n\nStep 5:\nTherefore, the arccosine of -1/2 is 2\u03c0/3 radians.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}"
