Two are above the horizontal line, and two are below it. They are vertical angles, which means they have the same measure.\n\nStep 3:\nWe can pair the angles above and below the horizontal line. Each pair forms a straight angle, which is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write two equations: x + x = 180 and x + x = 180.\n\nStep 4:\nSimplifying the equations, we get 2x = 180.\n\nStep 5:\nDividing both sides by 2, we get x = 90.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{90}"
