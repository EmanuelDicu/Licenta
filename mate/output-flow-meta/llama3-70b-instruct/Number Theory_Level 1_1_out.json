            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Here is the solution:\n\nStep 1:\nThe two prime numbers are distinct, so we need to find the largest possible product of two different prime numbers less than 40.\n\nStep 2:\nThe largest prime number less than 40 is 37. This is because 37 is a prime number and 41 is the next prime number, which is greater than 40.\n\nStep 3:\nSince one of the prime numbers must be the largest prime number less than 40, we can set one of the prime numbers to 37.\n\nStep 4:\nTo find the other prime number, we need to find the largest prime number less than 37. This is 31, because 31 is a prime number and 29 is the next prime number, which is less than 31.\n\nStep 5:\nNow, we can calculate the product of the two prime numbers: 37 \u00d7 31 = 1147.\n\nStep 6:\nTherefore, the greatest possible product of two distinct prime numbers less than 40 is 1147.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{1147}"
