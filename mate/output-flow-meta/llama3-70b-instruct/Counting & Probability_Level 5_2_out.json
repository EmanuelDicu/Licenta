Similarly, the number of ways to choose 2 columns out of 5 is \\binom{5}{2} = 10.\nStep 4:\nFor each choice of 2 rows and 2 columns, we can form exactly one square. Therefore, the total number of squares is 10 x 10 = 100.\nStep 5:\nHowever, this counts each square twice, because we can choose the vertices in either clockwise or counterclockwise order. Therefore, the actual number of squares is 100 / 2 = 50.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{50}"
