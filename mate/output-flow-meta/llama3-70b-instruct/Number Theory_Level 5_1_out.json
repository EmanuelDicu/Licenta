        "correct_solution": "Any factor of $3^6\\cdot5^{10}$ is in the form $3^a\\cdot5^b$ for $0\\le a\\le6$ and $0\\le b\\le{10}$. To count the number of perfect cube factors, we must count the factors of $3^6\\cdot5^{10}$ that have $a=0$, $3$, or $6$ and $b=0$, $3$, $6$, or $9$. This gives $3\\cdot4=\\boxed{12}$ perfect cube factors.",

            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Here is the solution:\n\nStep 1:\nThe prime factorization of $3^65^{10}$ is $3^65^{10}$ itself, since 3 and 5 are prime numbers.\n\nStep 2:\nA positive perfect cube factor of $3^65^{10}$ can be written as $3^a5^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are non-negative integers such that $a\\le 6$ and $b\\le 10$, and $a$ and $b$ are both multiples of 3 (since the factor is a perfect cube).\n\nStep 3:\nThe possible values of $a$ are $0, 3, 6$, and the possible values of $b$ are $0, 3, 6, 9$. Therefore, there are 3 options for $a$ and 4 options for $b$.\n\nStep 4:\nBy the fundamental counting principle, the number of positive perfect cube factors of $3^65^{10}$ is the product of the number of options for $a$ and $b$, which is $3\\cdot 4=12$.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{12}"
