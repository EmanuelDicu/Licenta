So, we can find the length of one side by finding the distance between any two adjacent vertices. \nStep 3:\nLet's find the distance between $(-2, 2)$ and $(2, -2)$. Using the distance formula $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$, we get $\\sqrt{(2-(-2))^2+(-2-2)^2}=\\sqrt{16+16}=\\sqrt{32}$.\nStep 4:\nSince $\\sqrt{32}=4\\sqrt{2}$, the length of each side of the square is $4\\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 5:\nThe area of a square is the square of the length of its side. So, the area of this square is $(4\\sqrt{2})^2=16\\cdot2=\\boxed{32}$.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{32}"
