        "correct_solution": "Notice that $(a+1)(a-5) = a^2 - 4a - 5$, so $a^2 - 4a + 1 = (a+1)(a-5) + 6$.\n\nAlso, we know that by the Euclidean algorithm, the greatest common divisor of $a+1$ and $a-5$ divides $6$: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(a+1, a-5) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(a+1-(a-5),a-5)\\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(6,a-5).\n\\end{align*}As $10508$ is even but not divisible by $3$, for the sum of the digits of $10508$ is $1 + 5 + 8 = 14$, it follows that the greatest common divisor of $a+1$ and $a-5$ must be $2$.\n\nFrom the identity $xy = \\text{lcm}\\,(x,y) \\cdot \\text{gcd}\\,(x,y)$ (consider the exponents of the prime numbers in the prime factorization of $x$ and $y$), it follows that \\begin{align*}\n(a+1)(a-5) &= \\text{lcm}\\,(a+1,a-5) \\cdot \\text{gcd}\\,(a+1, a-5) \\\\\n&= 2 \\cdot 10508.\n\\end{align*}Thus, the desired answer is $2 \\cdot 10508 + 6 = \\boxed{21022}.$\n\nWith a bit more work, we can find that $a = 147$.",
