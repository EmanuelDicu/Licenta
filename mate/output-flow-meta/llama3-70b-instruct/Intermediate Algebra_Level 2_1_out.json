Substituting y = x - 4 into this equation, we get x^3 - (x - 4)^3 = 28.\nStep 3:\nExpanding the cube, we get x^3 - (x^3 - 12x^2 + 48x - 64) = 28.\nStep 4:\nSimplifying the equation, we get 12x^2 - 48x + 36 = 0.\nStep 5:\nDividing both sides by 4, we get 3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0.\nStep 6:\nFactoring the quadratic equation, we get (3x - 3)(x - 3) = 0.\nStep 7:\nSolving for x, we get x = 1 or x = 3.\nStep 8:\nIf x = 1, then y = -3. If x = 3, then y = -1.\nStep 9:\nIn either case, xy = -3.\nStep 10:\nTherefore, the product of x and y is -3.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{-3}\n\"\"\""
