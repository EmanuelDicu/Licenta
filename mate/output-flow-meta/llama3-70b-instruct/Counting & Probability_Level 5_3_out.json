        "correct_solution": "We know that the number of subsets of any given set is equal to $2^n,$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the set. First, then, we need to find the number of composite divisors. The prime factorization of $72$ is $72=2^3 \\cdot 3^2,$ so there are $(3+1)(2+1)=12$ total divisors. (To see this, note that we can form a divisor of the form $2^a 3^b$ by freely choosing $a=0,1,2,3$ and $b=0,1,2$). Of these, $1$ is neither prime nor composite, and $2$ and $3$ are prime, for a total of $9$ composite divisors. Therefore there are $2^9=\\boxed{512}$ subsets of the divisors of $72$ with only composite divisors.",

Since there are 9 composite numbers, each of which can be either included or excluded from a subset, there are 2^9 = 512 possible subsets.\nStep 4:\nHowever, not all of these subsets contain only composite numbers. The subsets that include 1 are not valid. There are 2^8 = 256 subsets that include 1, so we must subtract these from the total.\nStep 5:\nTherefore, the number of subsets of the set of divisors of 72 that contain only composite numbers is 512 - 256 = 256.\nStep 6:\nInclude the empty set in the count: 256 + 1 = 257.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{257}"
