        "problem": "Sarah, James, and Matthew are on a team in a game show. In the game, Sarah always earns 5 points, Matthew always earns -2 points, and James always earns 3 points. To calculate their team's score, they multiply the first person's score by the second person's score, then subtract the third person's score. If they can choose the order in which they play the game, what is the maximum possible score that their team can earn?",
        "correct_solution": "If we let the first, second, and third persons' score equal $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively, then their team's score is $((a \\cdot b)-c)$.  We may test all six possible orderings:\n$a = 5$, $b = -2$, $c = 3 \\rightarrow ((5 \\cdot (-2)) - 3) = -13$\n$a = -2$, $b = 5$, $c = 3 \\rightarrow (((-2) \\cdot 5) - 3) = -13$\n$a = 5$, $b = 3$, $c = -2 \\rightarrow ((5 \\cdot 3) - (-2)) = 17$\n$a = 3$, $b = 5$, $c = -2 \\rightarrow ((3 \\cdot 5) - (-2)) = 17$\n$a = 3$, $b = -2$, $c = 5 \\rightarrow ((3 \\cdot (-2)) - 5) = -11$\n$a = -2$, $b = 3$, $c = 5 \\rightarrow (((-2) \\cdot 3) - 5) = -11$\nThus, our total answer is $\\boxed{17}$\nAdditionally, we may note that the only way to obtain a positive answer is to multiply the two positive scores together and subtract the negative score.  Because multiplication is commutative, the order of $a$ and $b$ does not matter, and we need only compute the single case $(3 \\cdot 5) - (-2) = \\boxed{17}$",

            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Here is the solution:\n\nStep 1:\nLet's analyze the given information: Sarah earns 5 points, Matthew earns -2 points, and James earns 3 points.\n\nStep 2:\nThe team's score is calculated by multiplying the first person's score by the second person's score, then subtracting the third person's score. We can represent this as:\n\nScore = (First person's score) \u00d7 (Second person's score) - (Third person's score)\n\nStep 3:\nTo maximize the score, we need to multiply the two highest scores together and subtract the lowest score. Since 5 is the highest score, 3 is the second-highest score, and -2 is the lowest score, we can arrange the order of play to maximize the score.\n\nStep 4:\nLet Sarah be the first person, James be the second person, and Matthew be the third person. Then, the score is calculated as:\n\nScore = (5) \u00d7 (3) - (-2) = 15 + 2 = 17\n\nStep 5:\nTherefore, the maximum possible score that the team can earn is 17.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{17}"
