Find out how many dumplings Leah's second friend ate.**\n\n* Leah's first friend ate 30 dumplings.\n* Her second friend ate twice as many, so they ate 30 * 2 = 60 dumplings.\n\n**2. Find out how many dumplings Leah ate.**\n\n* Leah's second friend ate 60 dumplings.\n* Leah ate 1.5 times that amount, so she ate 60 * 1.5 = 90 dumplings.\n\n**3. Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten.**\n\n* Leah ate 90 dumplings.\n* Her first friend ate 30 dumplings.\n* Her second friend ate 60 dumplings.\n* In total, they ate 90 + 30 + 60 = 180 dumplings.\n\n**Solution:** Leah and her friends ate a total of 180 dumplings. \n"
