Calculate points earned from wins:**\n\n* Andy's team won 15 games and gets 3 points per win.\n* Total points from wins: 15 games * 3 points/game = 45 points\n\n**2. Calculate points earned from ties:**\n\n* Andy's team tied 5 games and gets 1 point per tie.\n* Total points from ties: 5 games * 1 point/game = 5 points\n\n**3. Calculate total points earned so far:**\n\n* Total points earned: 45 points (wins) + 5 points (ties) = 50 points\n\n**4. Calculate how many more points are needed:**\n\n* Target points: 80 points\n* Points earned: 50 points\n* Points needed: 80 points - 50 points = 30 points\n\n**Answer:** Andy's team needs 30 more points to reach 80 points. \n"
