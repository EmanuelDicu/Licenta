            "gemini-1.5-pro": "Here's how we can break down the problem and solve it step-by-step:\n\n**1. Find the number of passengers on the flight:**\n\n* The plane is 2/3 full and has a capacity of 180 passengers.\n* Multiply the plane's capacity by 2/3:  (2/3) * 180 passengers = 120 passengers\n\n**2. Find the total number of carry-on bags:**\n\n* Each passenger brings 2 carry-on bags.\n* Multiply the number of passengers by the number of bags per passenger: 120 passengers * 2 bags/passenger = 240 bags\n\n**3. Calculate the total carry-on bag fees:**\n\n* The fee per bag is $35.\n* Multiply the total number of bags by the fee per bag: 240 bags * $35/bag = $8400\n\n**Solution:** Sunny Skies Airlines collects $8400 in carry-on bag fees for this flight. \n"
