Figure out how many months are left:**\n\n* January is already over.\n* We need to count February, March, April, and May.\n* That means there are **4** months left.\n\n**2. Calculate how many more books Molly needs to read:**\n\n* She needs to read 25 books total.\n* She's already read 5 books.\n* She needs to read 25 - 5 = **20** more books.\n\n**3. Determine the average number of books per month:**\n\n* Molly needs to read 20 more books.\n* She has 4 months left.\n* She needs to read an average of 20 / 4 = **5** books per month.\n\n**Solution:** Molly needs to read an average of 5 books per month from February to May to win the contest. \n"
