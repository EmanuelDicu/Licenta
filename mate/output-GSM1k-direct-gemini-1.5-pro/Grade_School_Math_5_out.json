Find the total number of yellow and green balls:**\n\n* Yellow balls + Green balls = 15 + 18 = 33 balls\n\n**2.  Calculate the target number of red balls:**\n\n* Double the number of yellow and green balls = 33 balls * 2 = 66 balls\n\n**3. Determine how many more red balls are needed:**\n\n* Target number of red balls - Current number of red balls = 66 balls - 12 balls = 54 balls\n\n**Solution:** Bradley and his friends need **54** more red balls. \n"
