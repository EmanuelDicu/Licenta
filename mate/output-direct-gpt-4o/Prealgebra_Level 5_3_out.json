        "problem": "In Mathopolis, an adult is a person 21 years of age or older and a child is a person under 21 years of age.  Exactly half of the  adults in Mathopolis are female, and exactly half of the female  adults have exactly one biological child.  Nobody else has a  child, and there are no other children.  What percent of the  people of Mathopolis are children?",
        "correct_solution": "Let the percentage of people in Mathopolis who are children be $x$. The percentage of adults is then $1-x$. Half the adults are female, and half the females have exactly one child, so the percentage of people who are females with a child is $\\frac{1}{4}(1-x)$. This percentage is equal to the percentage of children, since there is a correspondence between a mother and a child. So we have the equation $x=\\frac{1}{4}(1-x)$. Solving for $x$ yields $x=1/5$, or $\\boxed{20}$ percent.",

            "gpt-4o": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down into smaller, manageable parts and solve them step-by-step.\n\n### Part 1: Understand the Structure of the Population\n\n1. **Define the Groups:**\n    - Adults: People 21 years of age or older.\n    - Children: People under 21 years of age.\n    - Female Adults: Half of the adults.\n    - Female Adults with a Child: Half of the female adults.\n\n### Part 2: Set up the Relationships:\n\n1. **Total Population:**\n    - Let's assume the total number of people in Mathopolis is \\( P \\).\n\n2. **Adults and Children:**\n    - Let the number of adults be \\( A \\).\n    - The number of children is \\( C \\).\n    - Therefore, we have the relations:\n      \\[\n      A + C = P\n      \\]\n\n3. **Distribution among Adults:**\n    - Half of the adults are female, so the number of female adults is:\n      \\[\n      \\frac{A}{2}\n      \\]\n    - Half of the female adults have exactly one biological child. Therefore, the number of female adults with a child is:\n      \\[\n      \\frac{A}{4}\n      \\]\n\n4. **Number of Children:**\n    - Since each female adult with a child has exactly one child and no one else has a child:\n      \\[\n      C = \\frac{A}{4}\n      \\]\n\n### Part 3: Calculate Percentages:\n\n1. **Percentage of Children:**\n    - We need to find \\( \\frac{C}{P} \\times 100 \\% \\).\n\n2. **Relate the Number of Adults to Total Population:**\n    - From the relations \\( A + C = P \\) and \\( C = \\frac{A}{4} \\), we substitute \\( C \\):\n      \\[\n      A + \\frac{A}{4} = P\n      \\]\n    - Simplify:\n      \\[\n      \\frac{4A + A}{4} = P \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{5A}{4} = P \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad A = \\frac{4P}{5}\n      \\]\n\n3. **Substitute and Solve for \\( C \\):**\n    - Substituting \\( A = \\frac{4P}{5} \\) into \\( C = \\frac{A}{4} \\):\n      \\[\n      C = \\frac{\\frac{4P}{5}}{4} = \\frac{4P}{20} = \\frac{P}{5}\n      \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Percent of Children in the Population:**\n    - Using \\( \\frac{C}{P} \\times 100 \\% \\):\n      \\[\n      \\text{Percentage of Children} = \\left( \\frac{\\frac{P}{5}}{P} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 100\\% = 20\\%\n      \\]\n\n### Solution\n\nTherefore, **20% of the people of Mathopolis are children**."
