            "gpt-4o": "To solve the problem, let's consider the square with vertices at \\(0, a, b, c\\) in counterclockwise order on the complex plane. Since these points form a square, we can use the properties of complex numbers and rotations.\n\n1. **Identifying the vertices of the square:**\n\n   Let's consider \\(0\\) to be at the origin of the complex plane. Now, let\u2019s represent the points \\(a, b,\\) and \\(c\\) as complex numbers.\n\n2. **Relationship between vertices in a square:**\n\n   In a square, each vertex can be obtained by rotating the previous vertex by \\(90^\\circ\\) counterclockwise around the origin. In complex numbers, rotating a point \\(z\\) by \\(90^\\circ\\) counterclockwise is equivalent to multiplying \\(z\\) by \\(i\\) (the imaginary unit).\n\n3. **Rotation implications:**\n\n   - Thus, if \\(a\\) is a complex number representing one vertex, then \\(c = ia\\), because point \\(c\\) is rotated \\(90^\\circ\\) counterclockwise from \\(a\\).\n   - Simultaneously, \\(b\\) is another vertex found by rotating \\(a\\) by \\(180^\\circ\\) counterclockwise or \\(90^\\circ\\) in another step from \\(c\\); hence \\(b = i^2 a = -a\\).\n\n4. **Constructing all vertices:**\n    \\[\n    \\text{Let's summarize the vertices as follows:}\n    - 0 = 0\n    - a = a\n    - b = i a = -a\n    - c = i^2 a = i (ia) = -1 a = -a\n    \\]\n   However, these transformations revisit the fundamental property of the square - \\(90^\\circ\\) results as follows:\n\n   - 0\n   - \\(a\\)\n   - \\(b = ia\\)\n   - \\(c = i (ia) = -a\\) \n   \n   confirming \\(b=-ia\\) again\n\n5. **Calculate the given fraction:**\n\n    We need to compute \\(\\frac{ac + b^2}{ab}\\):\n\n    - Calculate \\(ac\\):\n        \\[\n        ac = a \\cdot (-ia) = -i a^2\n        \\]\n\n    - Calculate \\(b^2\\):\n        \\[\n        b^2 = (ia)^2 = i^2 a^2 = -a^2\n        \\]\n\n    - Substitute these into the expression \\(\\frac{ac + b^2}{ab}\\):\n        \\[\n        ac + b^2 = -i a^2 + (-a^2) = -i a^2 - a^2 = a^2 (-i - 1)\n        \\]\n        \\[\n        ab = a \\cdot (ia) = ai^2 = -a^2\n        \\]\n\n    \\[\n    \\frac{ac + b^2}{ab} = \\frac{a^2 (-i-1)}{-a^2} = \\frac{(-a^2(-i-1)}{a^2} \n    = i+1.\n    \\]\n    \nTherefore, the value of the expression \\(\\frac{ac + b^2}{ab}\\) is\n\n\\(\\boxed{i + 1}.\\)\n"
