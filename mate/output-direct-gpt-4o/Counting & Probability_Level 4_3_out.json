        "correct_solution": "The only way for the Dora to end up at her starting point in four steps is for her to traverse the four sides of the gray square.  She can do this in two ways: clockwise and counterclockwise. The probability of each of these two paths is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^4=\\frac{1}{256}$.  Therefore, the probability that she ends up where she started is $\\dfrac{1}{256}+\\dfrac{1}{256}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{128}}$.",

            "gpt-4o": "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Dora will walk completely around the gray square in her first four steps starting from point \\( A \\). The steps need to be done in one specific sequence to walk around the gray square in the correct order.\n\nThe intersections and possible movements form a grid where each intersection allows movement in four possible directions, but the specific requirement to walk around the square means we need those steps to form a closed loop around the square.\n\nHere's the detailed step-by-step logic to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Identifying the Required Path:**\n   - Starting at point \\( A \\), Dora needs to follow a specific cyclic path: either \\( A \\)\u2192\\( B \\)\u2192\\( C \\)\\(\\rightarrow\\) \\( D \\)\u2192\\( A \\) or the reverse direction \\( A \\)\u2192\\( D \\)\u2192\\( C \\)\\(\\rightarrow\\) \\( B \\)\u2192\\( A \\).\n\n2. **Number of Moves and Valid Direction Choices:**\n   - Assume the gray square vertices are \\( A (1,2) \\), \\( B (2,2) \\), \\( C (2,1) \\), and \\( D (1,1) \\).\n   - To walk around the square:\n     - From \\( A \\) (1, 2) to \\( B \\) (2, 2) - moving right\n     - From \\( B \\) (2, 2) to \\( C \\) (2, 1) - moving down\n     - From \\( C \\) (2, 1) to \\( D \\) (1, 1) - moving left\n     - From \\( D \\) (1, 1) back to \\( A \\) (1, 2) - moving up\n   - We need to consider the opposite cycle as well, but since Dora selects a direction uniformly at random, these paths essentially share equal probabilities once initiated.\n\n3. **Calculating the Desired Pathways:**\n   - The probability of following each particular direction correctly each time:\n     - Probability for the first move to be correct from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\): \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)\n     - Probability for subsequent moves assuming a correct start:\n       - \\( P(B \\rightarrow C \\mid A \\rightarrow B) = \\frac{1}{4} \\)\n       - \\( P(C \\rightarrow D \\mid B \\rightarrow C) = \\frac{1}{4} \\)\n       - \\( P(D \\rightarrow A \\mid C \\rightarrow D) = \\frac{1}{4} \\)\n   - Hence, the probability for completing one specified path is:\n     \\[\n     \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{256}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Accounting for Both Cyclic Paths:**\n   - Similarly, the backward cyclic path \\( A \\)\u2192\\( D \\)\u2192\\( C \\)\\(\\rightarrow\\) \\( B \\)\u2192\\( A \\) has an identical probability of \\(\\frac{1}{256}\\).\n   - Total probability when both cyclic paths are considered:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times \\frac{1}{256} = \\frac{2}{256} = \\frac{1}{128}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that Dora will walk completely around the gray square in her first four steps is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{128}}\n\\]"
