        "correct_solution": "Note that for $n\\geq 2$, the last two digits of $5^n$ are 25.  To prove this, note that $5^2\\equiv 25 \\pmod{100}$, and whenever $5^{n-1}\\equiv 25\\pmod{100}$, we also have $5^n=5\\cdot 5^{n-1}\\equiv 5\\cdot 25 \\equiv 125 \\equiv 25 \\pmod{100}$. Thus the tens digit of $5^{2005}$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",

            "gpt-4o": "To find the tens digit of \\(5^{2005}\\), you can proceed by examining the last two digits of \\(5^{2005}\\) because the tens digit is the second to the last digit. \n\n### Step 1: Understand the properties of powers of 5\n\nFirst, observe the pattern in the last two digits of the powers of 5:\n- \\(5^1 = 5\\)\n- \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n- \\(5^3 = 125\\), but the last two digits are 25\n- \\(5^4 = 625\\), but the last two digits are 25\n- \\(5^5 = 3125\\), but the last two digits are 25\n\nIt is clear that for any \\(n \\geq 2\\), \\(5^n\\) ends in 25.\n\n### Step 2: Confirm pattern for higher powers\n\nFrom above, we see that the last two digits of \\(5^2, 5^3, 5^4, \\ldots\\) are all 25. Therefore, \\(5^{2005}\\) will also end in 25. \n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nSince \\(5^{2005}\\) ends in 25, the tens digit of \\(5^{2005}\\) is the first digit of the number '25', which is 2.\n\nThus, the tens digit of \\(5^{2005}\\) is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."
