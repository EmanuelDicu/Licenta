            "gpt-4o": "To solve the congruence \\(3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}\\), we need to find an integer \\(n\\) in the range from 0 to 10 that satisfies the equation. Let's break down the problem into smaller steps:\n\n1. **Find the Multiplicative Inverse of 3 Modulo 11:**\n\n    To solve the congruence \\(3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}\\), we first need to determine the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11. The multiplicative inverse of an integer \\(a\\) modulo \\(m\\) is an integer \\(x\\) such that:\n    \\[\n    a \\cdot x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}\n    \\]\n    In this case, \\(a = 3\\) and \\(m = 11\\), so we need to find \\(x\\) such that:\n    \\[\n    3x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}\n    \\]\n\n2. **Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:**\n\n    To find \\(x\\), we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to express 1 as a linear combination of 3 and 11. Let's perform the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd):\n    \\[\n    11 = 3 \\cdot 3 + 2\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    3 = 2 \\cdot 1 + 1\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    2 = 1 \\cdot 2 + 0\n    \\]\n    Since the gcd is 1, we backtrack to write 1 as a combination of 3 and 11:\n    \\[\n    1 = 3 - (2 \\cdot 1)\n    \\]\n    Substitute \\(2\\) from the first equation:\n    \\[\n    2 = 11 - 3 \\cdot 3\n    \\]\n    So:\n    \\[\n    1 = 3 - (11 - 3 \\cdot 3) = 3 - 11 + 3 \\cdot 3 = 3 \\cdot 4 - 11\n    \\]\n    Therefore:\n    \\[\n    1 = 3 \\cdot 4 - 11\n    \\]\n    This tells us that the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11 is \\(4\\), because:\n    \\[\n    3 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}\n    \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(n\\):**\n\n    Now that we have the inverse, we can multiply both sides of the original congruence \\(3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}\\) by 4:\n    \\[\n    4 \\cdot 3n \\equiv 4 \\cdot 2 \\pmod{11}\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    12n \\equiv 8 \\pmod{11}\n    \\]\n    \n    Since \\(12 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}\\), this simplifies to:\n    \\[\n    n \\equiv 8 \\pmod{11}\n    \\]\n\n    Hence, the solution to the congruence is:\n    \\[\n    n \\equiv 8 \\pmod{11}\n    \\]\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is \\(n = 8\\)."
