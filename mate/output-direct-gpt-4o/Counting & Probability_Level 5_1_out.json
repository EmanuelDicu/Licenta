        "correct_solution": "The only one-digit integer divisible by $4$ that we can construct is $4$.\n\nWe can construct $3$ two-digit integers divisible by $4$: $12$, $32$, and $24$.\n\nAn integer is divisible by $4$ if its rightmost two digits are divisible by $4$.  Thus we can append either or both of the remaining two digits to any of these two-digit integers and preserve divisibility by $4$.  For each, there are $2$ ways to choose one digit to append, and $2$ ways to order the digits if we append both of them.

            "gpt-4o": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many different positive integers divisible by 4 can be formed using the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4, each at most once. \n\nFirst, we recall the condition for a number to be divisible by 4: the last two digits of the number must form a number that is divisible by 4. \n\nLet's break down the problem by considering different lengths of the numbers we can form:\n\n### 1-digit and 2-digit numbers:\n1. **1-digit numbers:**\n    - No 1-digit number using the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 is divisible by 4. Therefore, there are \\(0\\) such numbers.\n\n2. **2-digit numbers:**\n    - We need to check all 2-digit combinations of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    - The possible two-digit combinations are: 12, 13, 14, 21, 23, 24, 31, 32, 34, 41, 42, 43.\n    - We check which of these are divisible by 4:\n        - 12: Yes (12 \u00f7 4 = 3)\n        - 24: Yes (24 \u00f7 4 = 6)\n        - 32: Yes (32 \u00f7 4 = 8)\n            \n    The valid 2-digit numbers divisible by 4 are \\(12, 24, 32\\) - a total of \\(3\\) numbers.\n\n### 3-digit numbers:\nFor 3-digit numbers, the last two digits need to be divisible by 4. Let's analyze each possible ending:\n   - Since 12, 24, and 32 are divisible by 4, we can place another digit in front of these:\n        - For numbers ending in 12: Any of 3, 4 can be the hundreds digit. (Total: 2 possibilities 312, 412)\n        - For numbers ending in 24: Any of 1, 3 can be the hundreds digit. (Total: 2 possibilities 124, 324)\n        - For numbers ending in 32: Any of 1, 4 can be the hundreds digit. (Total: 2 possibilities 132, 432)\n\nSo the valid 3-digit numbers are \\(312, 412, 124, 324, 132, 432\\) \u2013 a total of \\(6\\) numbers. \n\n### 4-digit numbers:\nFor 4-digit numbers, the last two digits must again form a number divisible by 4. We will use the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 exactly once:\n    \n    - Consider the valid endings again: 12, 24, and 32.\n    - For each valid ending, the first two digits should use the remaining two digits:\n        - Ending in 12: Remaining digits are 3 and 4. Possible numbers: 3412, 4312 (Total: 2 possibilities)\n        - Ending in 24: Remaining digits are 1 and 3. Possible numbers: 1324, 3124 (Total: 2 possibilities)\n        - Ending in 32: Remaining digits are 1 and 4. Possible numbers: 1432, 4132 (Total: 2 possibilities)\n\nSo, the valid 4-digit numbers are \\(3412, 4312, 1324, 3124, 1432, 4132\\) - a total of \\(6\\) numbers.\n\n### Summing up all the valid numbers:\nThe total number of positive integers divisible by 4, using the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 at most once and counting all possible lengths of numbers (2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit) is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]\n\nThis includes:\n- 3 two-digit numbers (12, 24, 32),\n- 6 three-digit numbers (312, 412, 124, 324, 132, 432),\n- 6 four-digit numbers (3412, 4312, 1324, 3124, 1432, 4132)."
