            "gpt-4o": "To find the smallest whole number \\( b \\) such that 47 can be expressed in base \\( b \\) using only two digits, we need to understand how numbers are represented in different bases.\n\nA number \\( N \\) in base \\( b \\) is expressed as \\( N = d_1 \\times b^1 + d_0 \\times b^0 \\), where \\( d_1 \\) and \\( d_0 \\) are the digits in that base. Since we need only two digits, \\( d_1 \\) must be a nonzero digit (otherwise we'd just be representing the number with one digit).\n\nFor base \\( b \\), \\( N \\) can be written as:\n\\[ N = a \\cdot b + c \\]\nwhere \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) are digits in base \\( b \\), and since we're using only two digits, \\( a \\) must be between 1 and \\( b-1 \\), and \\( c \\) must be between 0 and \\( b-1 \\).\n\nFor the number 47:\n\\[ 47 = a \\cdot b + c \\]\nWe need to find the smallest \\( b \\) where this equation holds and \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) are valid digits.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Start by checking the smallest possible bases greater than the minimum of 2:**\n\n   - **Base \\( b = 2 \\)**:\n     \\( 47 \\) is written as \\( 101111_2 \\), which uses 6 digits, so not suitable.\n   - **Base \\( b = 3 \\)**:\n     \\( 47 \\) is written as \\( 1201_3 \\), which uses 4 digits, so not suitable.\n   - **Base \\( b = 4 \\)**:\n     \\( 47 \\) is written as \\( 223_4 \\), which uses 3 digits, so not suitable.\n   - **Base \\( b = 5 \\)**:\n     \\( 47 \\) is written as \\( 142_5 \\), which uses 3 digits, so not suitable.\n   - **Base \\( b = 6 \\)**:\n     \\( 47 \\) is written as \\( 115_6 \\), which uses 3 digits, so not suitable.\n   - **Base \\( b = 7 \\)**:\n     \\( 47 \\) is written as \\( 65_7 \\), which uses 2 digits. Satisfactory.\n\n    Therefore, we confirm if this can be in smaller bases.\n   - **Base \\( b = 8 \\)**:\n     \\( 47 \\) is written as \\( 57_8 \\), which uses 2 digits. Higher than 7.\n    - Checking further bases won't give smaller \\( b \\)\n\n2. **Verify for base \\( b = 7 \\):**\n\n   Since we checked up to base 7:\n\n   For \\( b = 7 \\):\n   \\[ 47 = a \\times 7 + c \\]\n   We assign  \\( 47 = 6 \\times 7 + 5 \\)\n   Therefore \\( 6 \\times 7 = 42 \\) so \\(  \\approx a = 6, c=5 \\);\n\n   Verifying:\n   \\( 47 = 6 \\times 7 + 5 = 42 + 5 \\)\n   which is correct.\n\nHence, the smallest base such that 47 can be expressed in base \\( b \\) using only two digits is \\( \\boxed{7} \\)."
