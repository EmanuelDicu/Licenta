Notice that it is a difference of squares, which has the general form \\( a^2 - b^2 \\).\n\n2. **Rewrite the expression in the form of a difference of squares**:\n   Recall that \\( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \\). Here, we need to express \\( 36 - 4x^2 \\) in this form.\n   Notice that:\n   \\[\n   36 = 6^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 4x^2 = (2x)^2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:\n   \\[\n   36 - 4x^2 = 6^2 - (2x)^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Apply the difference of squares formula**:\n   Using the formula \\( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \\), where \\( a = 6 \\) and \\( b = 2x \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   6^2 - (2x)^2 = (6 - 2x)(6 + 2x)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Check for further factorization**:\n   We should check if the factors \\( (6 - 2x) \\) and \\( (6 + 2x) \\) can be factored further. In this case, each factor is already in its simplest form and cannot be factored further.\n\n5. **Write the final factored form**:\n   The completely factored form of the expression \\( 36 - 4x^2 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   (6 - 2x)(6 + 2x)\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is:\n\\[\n36 - 4x^2 = (6 - 2x)(6 + 2x)\n\\]"
