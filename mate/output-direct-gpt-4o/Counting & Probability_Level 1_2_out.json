The outcome of one flip does not affect the outcome of the next flip.\n\n3. **Determine the Probability for Each Flip:**\n    - The sequence we want is Head, Tail, Head, Tail:\n        - Probability of first flip being Heads (H): \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n        - Probability of second flip being Tails (T): \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n        - Probability of third flip being Heads (H): \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n        - Probability of fourth flip being Tails (T): \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\n4. **Finding the Combined Probability:**\n    - The total probability of obtaining the sequence HTHT is found by multiplying the individual probabilities of each flip:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Total probability} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\n      \\]\n    - Simplifying this expression:\n      \\[\n      \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{16}\n      \\]\n\nThus, the probability that Ben flips Head, Tail, Head, Tail, in that exact order when flipping a fair nickel four times is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}\n\\]"
