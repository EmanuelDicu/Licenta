It can be helpful to decompose \\( AC \\) into the sum of smaller segments whose lengths we understand or can determine geometrically.\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown\n1. **Identify and Label Segments**:\n   - Let's consider \\( O \\) as the origin, and \\( C \\) positioned at coordinate 32 (hence \\( OC = 32 \\)).\n   - \\( B \\) is located 36 units to the right of \\( C \\) (hence \\( CB = 36 \\)).\n   \n2. **Interpret Semi-Circle Centers**:\n   - \\( O \\) is the center of the leftmost semicircle with radius \\( 32 \\).\n   - \\( M \\) is at coordinate \\( 68 \\) (32 + 36 = 68), the center of the right semicircle.\n   - \\( K \\) should be the midpoint between \\( A \\) and \\( C \\). Considering that \\( K \\) and \\( C \\) combined summarize the linear placement of three semi-circles, we look for symmetry and equal radius logic.\n\n3. **Linear Placement Analysis**:\n   - The length \\( OC \\) directly given is 32.\n   - The length \\( CB \\) is 36, so distances are consistent and segmentally continuous.\n   \n4. **Calculate Segment \\( AC \\)**:\n   - Given that \\( O \\) is 0, then until \\( C \\) is 32.\n   - From symmetrical observations and split segment methods, \\( AC \\) includes the direct span of these setups but includes no additional jumps beyond linear additions.\n   - \\( C-B \\) spans 36 providing right positions.\n\nSince \\( O \\) is direct, \\( A \\) is an amplified counter following as:\n\n### Mathematical Sum:\n\\[ AC = OC + CB\n    = 32 + 36\n    = 68 \\]\n\nThus every examination points to straightforward segment overlaid relevance.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe length of \\( AC \\):\n\\[ \\boxed{68} \\]"
