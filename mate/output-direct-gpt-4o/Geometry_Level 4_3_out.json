Distance between points \\((-2, 2)\\) and \\( (2, -2)\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(2 - (-2))^2 + (-2 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{4^2 + (-4)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 16} = \\sqrt{32} = 4\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n2. Distance between points \\( (2, -2)\\) and \\((-2, -6)\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(-2 - 2)^2 + (-6 - (-2))^2} = \\sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-4)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 16} = \\sqrt{32} = 4\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n3. Distance between points \\((-2, -6)\\) and \\((-6, -2)\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(-6 - (-2))^2 + (-2 - (-6))^2} = \\sqrt{(-4)^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 16} = \\sqrt{32} = 4\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n4. Distance between points \\((-6, -2)\\) and \\((-2, 2)\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(-2 - (-6))^2 + (2 - (-2))^2} = \\sqrt{4^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 16} = \\sqrt{32} = 4\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, all sides have equal length \\(4\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n#### Diagonal distances:\nTo verify that the diagonals are equal and twice the side length:\n- Distance between \\((-2, 2)\\) and \\((-2, -6)\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(-2 - (-2))^2 + (-6 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{0 + (-8)^2} = \\sqrt{64} = 8\n\\]\n\n- Distance between \\((2, -2)\\) and \\((-6, -2)\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(-6 - 2)^2 + (-2 - (-2))^2} = \\sqrt{(-8)^2 + 0} = \\sqrt{64} = 8\n\\]\n\nDiagonals are \\(8\\), which is twice the side length \\(4\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the side length of the square\nFrom our calculations, the side length \\( s \\) of the square is \\(4\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the area of the square\nThe area \\(A\\) of a square with side length \\( s \\) is given by:\n\\[\nA = s^2\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\\[\nA = (4\\sqrt{2})^2 = 16 \\times 2 = 32\n\\]\n\n### Final answer:\nThe area of the square is \\(32\\) square units."
