        "problem": "Hillary has eleven coins, all dimes and nickels. In total, the coins are worth 75 cents. How many nickels does she have?",
        "correct_solution": "Let the number of dimes Hillary has be $d$ and the number of nickels she has be $n$. We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\nd+n&=11\\\\\n10d+5n&=75\n\\end{align*} (The last equation is in terms of cents.) To make the second equation nicer, we divide both sides by 5 to get $2d+n=15$. From the first given equation, we have $d=11-n$. Substituting this into the simplified second given equation to eliminate $d$, we get $2(11-n)+n=15\\Rightarrow n=7$. Thus, Hillary has $\\boxed{7}$ nickels.",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Define the variables\nLet:\n- \\( n \\) be the number of nickels\n- \\( d \\) be the number of dimes\n\n### Step 2: Set up the equations from the problem\nWe have two key pieces of information:\n1. Hillary has a total of 11 coins.\n2. These coins are worth a total of 75 cents.\n\nFrom the first piece of information, we can write the equation:\n\\[ n + d = 11 \\]\n\nFrom the second piece of information, knowing that nickels are worth 5 cents and dimes are worth 10 cents, we can write:\n\\[ 5n + 10d = 75 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the equations\nWe can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 5:\n\\[ n + 2d = 15 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve the system of equations\nNow we have the simplified system:\n1. \\( n + d = 11 \\)\n2. \\( n + 2d = 15 \\)\n\nWe can solve this system using the elimination method. Start by subtracting the first equation from the second to eliminate \\( n \\):\n\\[ (n + 2d) - (n + d) = 15 - 11 \\]\n\\[ d = 4 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Solve for \\( n \\)\nNow that we know \\( d = 4 \\), substitute this value back into the first equation to find \\( n \\):\n\\[ n + 4 = 11 \\]\n\\[ n = 7 \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nHillary has 7 nickels.\n\n### Verification\nTo ensure our solution is correct, let's verify:\n- The total number of coins is \\( 7 \\) nickels and \\( 4 \\) dimes: \\( 7 + 4 = 11 \\)\n- The total value is \\( 7 \\times 5 \\) cents + \\( 4 \\times 10 \\) cents: \\( 35 \\) cents + \\( 40 \\) cents = \\( 75 \\) cents\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so our solution is correct.\n\n**Therefore, Hillary has 7 nickels.**"
