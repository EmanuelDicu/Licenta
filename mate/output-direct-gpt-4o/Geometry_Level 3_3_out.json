Solving for $x$ and $y$, we find $x = 16$ and $y = 24$.  Hence, the perimeter of one of the five congruent rectangles is $2x + 2y = \\boxed{80}$.",

            "gpt-4o": "To solve the problem, let's start by understanding the given conditions and the configuration of the rectangle and its smaller, congruent rectangles.\n\n1. **Understanding the Given Information:**\n   - We have a large rectangle with a perimeter of 176.\n   - This large rectangle is divided into five congruent smaller rectangles.\n   - The diagram shows that there are three small rectangles on the top row and two on the bottom row.\n\n2. **Setting Up Variables:**\n   - Let the dimensions of the large rectangle be \\( L \\) (length) and \\( W \\) (width).\n   - The perimeter \\( P \\) of the large rectangle is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     P = 2L + 2W\n     \\]\n   - According to the problem, this perimeter equals 176:\n     \\[\n     2L + 2W = 176\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solving for \\( L \\) and \\( W \\):**\n   - Simplifying the equation:\n     \\[\n     L + W = 88\n     \\]\n   - Now, let's analyze how the rectangle is divided into five congruent smaller rectangles.\n\n4. **Dimensions of Smaller Rectangles:**\n   - The five smaller rectangles are congruent, meaning they all have equal dimensions.\n   - Let's denote the length and width of one of these smaller rectangles as \\( l \\) and \\( w \\) respectively.\n   - The top three rectangles form the top section of the large rectangle, implying the width \\( W \\) of the entire large rectangle equals the width of one small rectangle:\n     \\[\n     W = w\n     \\]\n   - Similarly, the length \\( L \\) of the entire large rectangle is three times the length of one small rectangle:\n     \\[\n     L = 3l\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculating the Dimensions of Smaller Rectangles:**\n   - Substitute \\( L \\) and \\( W \\) from above into the equation \\( L + W = 88 \\):\n     \\[\n     3l + w = 88\n     \\]\n   - Note that the two rectangles at the bottom are positioned side by side; they have the same width \\( w \\) but span the whole length, validating that:\n     \\[\n     l+w = 88\n     \\]\n     Using these equations, let's solve for \\( l \\) and \\( w \\).\n\n6. **Confirm the Configuration:**\n   - Given the structure of the large rectangle, and fact that the smaller congruent rectangles ensure \\( W = 2w \\).\n     Substituting into the length, \n     \\[\n     L = 3l \\\\\n     l + w/2 = 88 \n     \\]\nThe final challenge involves solving these and confirming correct perimeter for each small rectangle.\n\n7. **Finally, solving for smaller rectangle perimeter:**\nPlugging back numerical substitutions Andalytic checks:\n     Length = W*3 = 88 with this need , perimeter\n   \nBy confirming general structure,\n\nNotice an inherent switch in \\(  L\\%. confirming:\nTherefore .
