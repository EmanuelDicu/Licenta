We start by calculating the areas of these two circles:\n\n1. \\( \\text{Area of the largest circle} = \\pi \\times (13)^2 = \\pi \\times 169 \\)\n2. \\( \\text{Area of the middle circle} = \\pi \\times (12)^2 = \\pi \\times 144 \\)\n\nNext, we find the area of the ring between the two largest circles:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the ring} = \\pi \\times 169 - \\pi \\times 144 = \\pi (169 - 144) = \\pi \\times 25\n\\]\n\nSo, the area of the ring is \\(25\\pi\\).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the radius of the smallest circle\n\nWe know that the area of the ring (\\(25\\pi\\)) equals the area of the smallest circle. Let the radius of the smallest circle be \\(r\\). Therefore, the area of the smallest circle is:\n\n\\[\n\\pi r^2 = 25\\pi\n\\]\n\nTo find \\(r\\):\n\n\\[\nr^2 = 25\n\\]\n\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{25} = 5\n\\]\n\nThus, the radius of the smallest circle is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
