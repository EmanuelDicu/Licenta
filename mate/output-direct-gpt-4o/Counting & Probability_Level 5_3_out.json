        "correct_solution": "We know that the number of subsets of any given set is equal to $2^n,$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the set. First, then, we need to find the number of composite divisors. The prime factorization of $72$ is $72=2^3 \\cdot 3^2,$ so there are $(3+1)(2+1)=12$ total divisors. (To see this, note that we can form a divisor of the form $2^a 3^b$ by freely choosing $a=0,1,2,3$ and $b=0,1,2$). Of these, $1$ is neither prime nor composite, and $2$ and $3$ are prime, for a total of $9$ composite divisors. Therefore there are $2^9=\\boxed{512}$ subsets of the divisors of $72$ with only composite divisors.",

Factorize \\( 72 \\) into its prime factors:\n\\[ 72 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\]\nThe divisors are produced by taking all combinations of these prime factors:\n\\[ 72 \\text{ has divisors } \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\\} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Identify which divisors are composite\nA composite number has more than two distinct positive divisors. We list the composite divisors:\n\\[ 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72 \\]\n\nThe set of composite divisors of \\( 72 \\) is:\n\\[ \\{4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\\} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Count the subsets of the set of composite divisors\nThe number of subsets of a set is given by \\( 2^n \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of elements in the set. Here, \\( n = 9 \\) for the composite divisors.\n\nThus, the number of subsets of the set \\(\\{4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\\}\\) is:\n\\[ 2^9 = 512 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Include the empty set\nThe empty set is a subset of every set, including our set of composite divisors, and is already included in the \\( 2^9 \\) calculation.\n\n### Conclusion\nCombining all parts, the total number of subsets of the set of divisors of \\( 72 \\) that contain only composite numbers, including the empty set, is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{512}\n\\]"
