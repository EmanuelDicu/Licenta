            "gpt-4o": "To determine how many positive perfect cube factors \\(3^6 \\cdot 5^{10}\\) has, let's follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Number\nGiven number: \\(3^6 \\cdot 5^{10}\\).\n\n### Step 2: Define a Perfect Cube\nA positive integer \\(n\\) is a perfect cube if it can be written as \\(n = x^3\\) for some integer \\(x\\). This means that any factor \\(n = 3^a \\cdot 5^b\\) of \\(3^6 \\cdot 5^{10}\\) must have \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) both multiples of 3.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Possible Values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\nSince the factor must be of the form \\(3^a \\cdot 5^b\\):\n- The exponents \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must each be multiples of 3.\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- For \\(3^6\\), the possible values for \\(a\\) are \\(0, 3,\\) and \\(6\\) (since \\(a\\) can range from 0 to 6 and must be a multiple of 3).\n- For \\(5^{10}\\), the possible values for \\(b\\) are \\(0, 3, 6,\\) and \\(9\\) (since \\(b\\) can range from 0 to 10 and must be a multiple of 3).\n\n### Step 4: Count the Combinations\n- The possible values for \\(a\\) (multiples of 3 up to 6) are: \\(0, 3, 6\\). There are 3 possibilities.\n- The possible values for \\(b\\) (multiples of 3 up to 9) are: \\(0, 3, 6, 9\\). There are 4 possibilities.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Combinations\nSince the choices for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent, we multiply the number of choices for each:\n\\[\n\\text{Total combinations} = 3 \\times 4 = 12\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe number of positive perfect cube factors of \\(3^6 \\cdot 5^{10}\\) is \\( \\boxed{12} \\)."
