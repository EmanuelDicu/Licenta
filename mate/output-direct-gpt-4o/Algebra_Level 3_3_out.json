        "correct_solution": "Recall that for positive integers $a$ and $b$ $x^a x^b = x^{a+b}$.  Thus, if $h(x)$, $f(x)$, and $g(x)$ are polynomials such that $h(x)=f(x) \\cdot g(x)$ and if $ x^a $ and $ x^b $ are the highest degree terms of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ then the highest degree term of $h(x)$ will be $x^{a+b}$.  In our case $f(x) = x^2-7x+10$, the highest degree term is $x^2$ and $h(x)$ has highest degree term $x^5$.  Thus, solving for $b$ in the equation $x^5 = x^2 x^b = x^{2+b}$, we find $b=\\boxed{3}$.",

            "gpt-4o": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the degree \\( b \\) of the polynomial \\( g(x) \\) given the polynomial \\( h(x) \\) which is of degree 5. We are given the equation:\n\\[ h(x) = (x^2 - 7x + 10) \\cdot g(x). \\]\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Degrees of Polynomials\n\n1. **Degree of \\( h(x) \\)**:\n   Given that \\( h(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 5.\n   \n2. **Degree of \\( x^2 - 7x + 10 \\)**:\n   This is a quadratic polynomial, and its degree is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Using the Product Rule for Polynomial Degrees\n\nThe degree of the product of two polynomials is the sum of the degrees of the individual polynomials. So if:\n\\[ h(x) = (x^2 - 7x + 10) \\cdot g(x), \\]\nthen:\n\\[ \\text{degree of } h(x) = \\text{degree of } (x^2 - 7x + 10) + \\text{degree of } g(x). \\]\n\n### Step 3: Setting Up the Degree Equation\n\nWe know the degrees of \\( h(x) \\) and \\( x^2 - 7x + 10 \\):\n\\[ 5 = 2 + \\text{degree of } g(x). \\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve for the Degree of \\( g(x) \\)\n\nWe can isolate the degree of \\( g(x) \\) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ \\text{degree of } g(x) = 5 - 2. \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{degree of } g(x) = 3. \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the degree \\( b \\) of the polynomial \\( g(x) \\) is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3}. \\]"
