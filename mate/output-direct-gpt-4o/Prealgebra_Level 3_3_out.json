Thus, \\(8 \\times h = 40\\).\n   - Solving for \\(h\\):\n     \\[\n     8h = 40 \\implies h = 5\n     \\]\n   - So the dimensions of rectangle \\(ABCD\\) are \\(8 \\times 5\\).\n\n3. **Locate Points M and N**:\n   - \\(M\\) divides \\(AB\\) into two equal parts, each of length \\(4\\).\n   - \\(N\\) is on the line \\(CD\\), ensuring that \\(CN = 2\\) (as given).\n\n4. **Dimensions of Rectangle \\(MBCN\\)**:\n   - The length of rectangle \\(MBCN\\) is the horizontal distance from \\(M\\) to \\(B\\), which is \\(MB = 4\\).\n   - The width of rectangle \\(MBCN\\) is the vertical distance from \\(M\\) (on the top side) to \\(N\\) (directly below \\(M\\)), which covers the entire height of \\(ABCD\\) (minus the remaining piece) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\).\n   - We know from point C to N on line CD is \\(2\\), so from M to N we have \\(5\\) (total height) - \\(2\\) = \\(3\\).\n\n5. **Calculate Area of \\(MBCN\\)**:\n   - The area is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = 4 \\times 3 = 12\n   \\]\n\nSo, the area of rectangle \\(MBCN\\) is \\( \\boxed{12} \\)."
