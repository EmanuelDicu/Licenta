Find the sum of those multiples.\n\nLet's start with identifying the two-digit multiples of 7. A two-digit number ranges from 10 to 99. We need to find all two-digit numbers that are multiples of 7 within this range.\n\nThe smallest two-digit multiple of 7 is found by calculating:\n\\[\n7 \\times 2 = 14\n\\]\nThe largest two-digit multiple of 7 is found by calculating:\n\\[\n7 \\times 14 = 98\n\\]\n\nSo the two-digit multiples of 7 are:\n\\[\n14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to check which of these multiples have digits that sum up to 10. Let's check each:\n\n- \\(14 \\Rightarrow 1 + 4 = 5\\)\n- \\(21 \\Rightarrow 2 + 1 = 3\\)\n- \\(28 \\Rightarrow 2 + 8 = 10\\)\n- \\(35 \\Rightarrow 3 + 5 = 8\\)\n- \\(42 \\Rightarrow 4 + 2 = 6\\)\n- \\(49 \\Rightarrow 4 + 9 = 13\\)\n- \\(56 \\Rightarrow 5 + 6 = 11\\)\n- \\(63 \\Rightarrow 6 + 3 = 9\\)\n- \\(70 \\Rightarrow 7 + 0 = 7\\)\n- \\(77 \\Rightarrow 7 + 7 = 14\\)\n- \\(84 \\Rightarrow 8 + 4 = 12\\)\n- \\(91 \\Rightarrow 9 + 1 = 10\\)\n- \\(98 \\Rightarrow 9 + 8 = 17\\)\n\nFrom the above calculations, the multiples of 7 that have a digit sum of 10 are:\n\\[\n28 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 91\n\\]\n\nTo find the sum of these two multiples, we calculate:\n\\[\n28 + 91 = 119\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the two multiples of 7 with a digit sum of 10 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{119}\n\\]"
