        "correct_solution": "For a circle of radius $r$ and an arc of $\\theta$ degrees, the arc length is $(2\\pi r)\\frac{\\theta}{360}$. Thus, for the same arc length, the arc angle is inversely proportional to the radius, so the ratio of the radius of circle $A$ to the radius of circle $B$ is $40:55$, or $8:11$. Since the ratio of the areas of two circles is the square of the ratio of their radii, the ratio of the area of circle $A$ to the area of circle $B$ is $(8/11)^2=\\boxed{\\frac{64}{121}}$.",

Here are the steps we will follow:\n\n1. Calculate the length of the arcs using the formulas for arc length.\n2. Set the arc lengths equal to each other.\n3. Use this equality to find a relationship between the radii of circles \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n4. Use the relationship between the radii to find the ratio of the areas of the two circles.\n\nLet's start by recalling the formula for the length of an arc. For a circle with radius \\( r \\) and an arc subtended by an angle \\( \\theta \\) (in degrees), the arc length \\( s \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{\\theta}{360^\\circ} \\times 2\\pi r = \\frac{\\theta \\pi r}{180^\\circ}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the arc lengths\n\nFor circle \\( A \\):\n- The radius is \\( r_A \\).\n- The angle of \\( 55^\\circ \\).\n- The arc length is:\n  \\[\n  s_A = \\frac{55 \\pi r_A}{180}\n  \\]\n\nFor circle \\( B \\):\n- The radius is \\( r_B \\).\n- The angle of \\( 40^\\circ \\).\n- The arc length is:\n  \\[\n  s_B = \\frac{40 \\pi r_B}{180}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Set the arc lengths equal\n\nGiven that these arc lengths are equal, we can write:\n\\[\n\\frac{55 \\pi r_A}{180} = \\frac{40 \\pi r_B}{180}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve for the relationship between \\( r_A \\) and \\( r_B \\)\n\nWe can cancel the common factors (the \\( \\pi \\) and \\( 180 \\)) from both sides:\n\\[\n55 r_A = 40 r_B\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 40:\n\\[\n\\frac{55}{40} r_A = r_B\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\\[\n\\frac{11}{8} r_A = r_B \\quad \\implies \\quad r_B = \\frac{11}{8} r_A\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the ratio of the areas\n\nThe area \\( A \\) of a circle is given by \\( A = \\pi r^2 \\).\n\nLet's find the areas of circle \\( A \\) and circle \\( B \\):\n\\[\n\\text{Area of circle } A = \\pi r_A^2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Area of circle } B = \\pi r_B^2\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( r_B \\) from the relationship found:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of circle } B = \\pi \\left(\\frac{11}{8} r_A\\right)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Area of circle } B = \\pi \\left(\\frac{121}{64} r_A^2\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Area of circle } B = \\frac{121}{64} \\pi r_A^2\n\\]\n\nNow, find the ratio of the area of circle \\( A \\) to the area of circle \\( B \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Area of circle } A}{\\text{Area of circle } B} = \\frac{\\pi r_A^2}{\\frac{121}{64} \\pi r_A^2}\n\\]\n\nThe \\( \\pi r_A^2 \\) terms cancel out:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Area of circle } A}{\\text{Area of circle } B} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{121}{64}} = \\frac{64}{121}\n\\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the area of circle \\( A \\) to the area of circle \\( B \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{64}{121}}\n\\]"
