        "correct_solution": "Imagine two identical clock hands, each rotating counterclockwise and both initially pointing directly to the right.  If one of them rotates at 1 radian per second while the other rotates at $1^{\\circ}$ per second, then the faster one will sweep out an angle of $t$ radians at the same time that the slower one travels through $t$ degrees.  We wish to know approximately when the cosines of the corresponding angles will be equal, i.e. when the $x$-coordinates of the tips of the clock hands will be the same.\n\nClearly this will occur when the faster hand has rotated nearly all the way around the circle.  After six seconds the slow hand will have rotated only $6^{\\circ}$, while the fast hand will have traveled around 6 radians, which is still further than $6^{\\circ}$ away from its starting point.  (Recall that 1 radian is equal to $\\frac{180^{\\circ}}{\\pi}$, which is a couple degrees less than $60^{\\circ}$.)  Therefore the $x$-coordinates will not yet be equal for the first time, but will be very close.  We conclude that $\\lfloor t\\rfloor=\\boxed{6}$.  The interested reader may wish to compute the exact value of $t$ for which this occurs.  You should find that $t= \\frac{360\\pi}{\\pi+180}\\approx 6.1754$.",

            "gpt-4o": "To solve the given problem, we need to find the smallest positive real number \\( t \\) such that \\( \\cos t = \\cos t^{\\circ} \\), where \\( \\cos t \\) is in radians and \\( \\cos t^{\\circ} \\) is in degrees. Let's break the problem into smaller parts and solve step-by-step.\n\n1. **Conversion between radians and degrees:**\n\n    Recall that \\( 1 \\) radian is equivalent to \\( \\frac{180}{\\pi} \\) degrees. Thus, \\( t \\) radians can be converted to degrees by multiplying by \\( \\frac{180}{\\pi} \\). Hence, the equation can be written as:\n    \\[\n    \\cos t = \\cos \\left( t \\cdot \\frac{180}{\\pi} \\right)\n    \\]\n\n2. **Cosine function periodicity:**\n\n    The cosine function has a period of \\( 2\\pi \\) in radians and \\( 360^\\circ \\) in degrees.
