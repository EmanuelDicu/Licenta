        "correct_solution": "We know that the number of subsets of any given set is equal to $2^n,$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the set. First, then, we need to find the number of composite divisors. The prime factorization of $72$ is $72=2^3 \\cdot 3^2,$ so there are $(3+1)(2+1)=12$ total divisors. (To see this, note that we can form a divisor of the form $2^a 3^b$ by freely choosing $a=0,1,2,3$ and $b=0,1,2$). Of these, $1$ is neither prime nor composite, and $2$ and $3$ are prime, for a total of $9$ composite divisors. Therefore there are $2^9=\\boxed{512}$ subsets of the divisors of $72$ with only composite divisors.",

            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them logically.\n\n**Part 1: Find the divisors of 72**\n\nThe first step is to find all the divisors of 72. We can do this by listing out the factors of 72:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\n\n**Part 2: Identify the composite numbers among the divisors**\n\nA composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. In our list of divisors, the composite numbers are:\n\n4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36\n\n**Part 3: Find the number of subsets containing only composite numbers**\n\nWe need to find the number of subsets of the set of composite numbers. Let's call this set C. Since C has 8 elements, the total number of subsets of C is 2^8 = 256.\n\nHowever, not all of these subsets contain only composite numbers. For example, the subset {4, 1} contains the non-composite number 1. We need to exclude such subsets from our count.\n\n**Part 4: Exclude subsets containing non-composite numbers**\n\nLet's consider the subsets that contain at least one non-composite number. These are the subsets that contain 1, 2, 3, or any combination of these numbers along with some composite numbers.\n\nThe number of subsets that contain 1 is 2^7 = 128, since we can choose any of the 7 remaining composite numbers to form a subset with 1.\n\nSimilarly, the number of subsets that contain 2 is 2^7 = 128, and the number of subsets that contain 3 is 2^7 = 128.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the subsets that contain two or more non-composite numbers. For example, the subset {1, 2, 4} has been counted three times: once in the subsets containing 1, once in the subsets containing 2, and once in the subsets containing both 1 and 2.\n\nTo avoid this overcounting, we need to subtract the number of subsets that contain two or more non-composite numbers.\n\nThe number of subsets that contain 1 and 2 is 2^6 = 64, since we can choose any of the 6 remaining composite numbers to form a subset with 1 and 2.\n\nSimilarly, the number of subsets that contain 1 and 3 is 2^6 = 64, and the number of subsets that contain 2 and 3 is 2^6 = 64.\n\nThe number of subsets that contain all three non-composite numbers (1, 2, and 3) is 2^5 = 32.\n\n**Part 5: Calculate the final answer**\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of subsets containing only composite numbers by subtracting the number of subsets that contain non-composite numbers from the total number of subsets:\n\n256 - 128 - 128 - 128 + 64 + 64 + 64 - 32 = 128\n\nThis includes the empty set, which is a subset of C that contains no elements.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is **128**."
