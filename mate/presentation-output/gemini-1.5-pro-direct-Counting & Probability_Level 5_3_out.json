        "correct_solution": "We know that the number of subsets of any given set is equal to $2^n,$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the set. First, then, we need to find the number of composite divisors. The prime factorization of $72$ is $72=2^3 \\cdot 3^2,$ so there are $(3+1)(2+1)=12$ total divisors. (To see this, note that we can form a divisor of the form $2^a 3^b$ by freely choosing $a=0,1,2,3$ and $b=0,1,2$). Of these, $1$ is neither prime nor composite, and $2$ and $3$ are prime, for a total of $9$ composite divisors. Therefore there are $2^9=\\boxed{512}$ subsets of the divisors of $72$ with only composite divisors.",

            "gemini-1.5-pro": "## Solving the Subsets Problem\n\nHere's how we can break down the problem and solve it:\n\n**1. Find the divisors of 72:**\n\n* Start by finding the prime factorization of 72:  72 = 2\u00b3 * 3\u00b2 \n* To find all divisors, consider the exponents in the prime factorization.  We increase each exponent by 1 and multiply them together: (3+1)(2+1) = 12. This means 72 has 12 divisors.\n* List out the divisors systematically: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\n\n**2. Identify the composite divisors:**\n\n* Recall that a composite number has more than two factors (including 1 and itself).\n* From the list, the composite divisors are: 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\n\n**3. Count the subsets containing only composite divisors:**\n\n* We have 9 composite divisors. Think of forming a subset as making 9 decisions \u2013 for each divisor, we choose to either include it in our subset or not.\n* This gives us 2 options (include or not include) for each of the 9 divisors. \n* Therefore, there are 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 2\u2079 = 512 possible subsets.\n\n**4. Don't forget the empty set:**\n\n* The empty set is a subset of any set, and it fits our criteria (contains only composite numbers, because it contains none!).\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThere are **513** subsets of the divisors of 72 that contain only composite numbers. \n"
