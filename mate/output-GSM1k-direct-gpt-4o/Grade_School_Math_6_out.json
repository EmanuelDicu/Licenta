To find her total weekly earnings, we need to multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works per week.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Weekly Earnings} = \\text{Hourly Wage} \\times \\text{Hours per Week}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Weekly Earnings} = 15 \\, \\text{dollars/hour} \\times 30 \\, \\text{hours/week}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Weekly Earnings} = 450 \\, \\text{dollars/week}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the total amount needed\nThe car Marge wants to buy costs $3600.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost of the Car} = 3600 \\, \\text{dollars}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks needed to earn the total amount\nNow we need to figure out how many weeks Marge needs to work to accumulate the $3600 required for the car. This is done by dividing the total cost of the car by her weekly earnings:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Weeks} = \\frac{\\text{Total Cost of the Car}}{\\text{Weekly Earnings}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Weeks} = \\frac{3600 \\, \\text{dollars}}{450 \\, \\text{dollars/week}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Perform the division\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Weeks} = \\frac{3600}{450} = 8\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nMarge needs to work for 8 weeks to earn enough money to buy the car. \n\nSo, the solution to the problem is:\n\n**Marge needs to work for 8 weeks to buy the car.**"
