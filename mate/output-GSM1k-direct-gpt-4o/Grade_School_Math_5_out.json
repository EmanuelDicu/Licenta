Let's break down the problem into smaller steps and solve each part methodically.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Understand the current counts of each type of ball:**\n   - Red balls (R): 12\n   - Yellow balls (Y): 15\n   - Green balls (G): 18\n\n2. **Calculate the combined number of yellow and green balls:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Combined number of yellow and green balls} = Y + G = 15 + 18\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Combined number of yellow and green balls} = 33\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the desired number of red balls to be twice the combined number of yellow and green balls:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Desired number of red balls} = 2 \\times \\text{Combined number of yellow and green balls} = 2 \\times 33\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Desired number of red balls} = 66\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate how many additional red balls are needed:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Additional red balls needed} = \\text{Desired number of red balls} - \\text{Current number of red balls}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Additional red balls needed} = 66 - 12\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Additional red balls needed} = 54\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Bradley and his friends need to add **54** additional red balls to their current collection to have twice the number of red balls compared to the combined number of yellow and green balls.\n\n### Solution to the Problem\nBradley and his friends require 54 additional red balls to double the number of red balls compared to the combined number of yellow and green balls."
