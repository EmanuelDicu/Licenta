            "gpt-4o": "Sure! Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Total Number of Books Molly Needs to Read\nMolly needs to read a total of 25 books to win the contest.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Books Molly Has Already Read\nBy the end of January, Molly has already read 5 books.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Books Left to Read\nTo find out how many more books Molly needs to read, we subtract the number of books she has already read from the total number of books needed:\n\\[ \\text{Books left to read} = 25 - 5 = 20 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Number of Months Left to Read the Remaining Books\nSince Molly has read these books by the end of January, she has the months of February, March, April, and May left to read the remaining books. This totals to:\n\\[ \\text{Months left} = 4 \\text{ months} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Average Number of Books Molly Needs to Read Each Month\nTo find the average number of books Molly needs to read each month, we divide the total number of books left to read by the number of months left:\n\\[ \\text{Average books per month} = \\frac{\\text{Books left to read}}{\\text{Months left}} = \\frac{20}{4} = 5 \\]\n\n### Solution Conclusion\nMolly needs to read **5 books on average each month** from February to May to win the contest.\n\nThus, the solution to the problem is that Molly needs to read 5 more books on average each month until the end of May."
