We need to determine the average percentage of candies left for each flavor, and then compute the overall average percentage.\n\n### Step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Determine the initial and remaining amount of each candy flavor:**\n   - Francis started with 20 lemon, 20 orange, and 20 cherry-flavored candies.\n\n2. **Calculate how many candies of each flavor are left:**\n   - Lemon: He ate 10 lemon candies out of 20.\n     \\[ 20 - 10 = 10 \\text{ lemon candies left} \\]\n   - Orange: He ate 4 orange candies out of 20.\n     \\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \\text{ orange candies left} \\]\n   - Cherry: He ate 16 cherry candies out of 20.\n     \\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \\text{ cherry candies left} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the percentage of each type of candy that is still left:**\n   - Lemon:\n     \\[ \\frac{10 \\text{ (left)}}{20 \\text{ (initial)}} \\times 100 = 50\\% \\]\n   - Orange:\n     \\[ \\frac{16 \\text{ (left)}}{20 \\text{ (initial)}} \\times 100 = 80\\% \\]\n   - Cherry:\n     \\[ \\frac{4 \\text{ (left)}}{20 \\text{ (initial)}} \\times 100 = 20\\% \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the average percentage of candies left across all flavors:**\n   - Add the percentages and divide by the number of flavors (3):\n     \\[ \\frac{50\\% + 80\\% + 20\\%}{3} = \\frac{150\\%}{3} = 50\\% \\]\n\n### Solution:\nThe average percentage of candies still left is \\(50\\%\\)."
