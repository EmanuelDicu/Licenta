If one gallon of paint costs $35 and the painter gets a bulk discount of 10% for purchases over 30 gallons, how much will the paint cost in total?",

            "gpt-4o": "Let's solve the problem step-by-step by breaking it down into smaller parts.\n\n1. **Determine the amount of paint needed for each house:**\n   - The first house requires 14 gallons of paint.\n   - The second house requires twice as much paint as the first house. So the second house needs \\(2 \\times 14 = 28\\) gallons of paint.\n   - The third house needs half as much paint as the second house. So the third house needs \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 28 = 14\\) gallons of paint.\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount of paint required:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total paint} = 14 \\text{ gallons (first house)} + 28 \\text{ gallons (second house)} + 14 \\text{ gallons (third house)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total paint} = 14 + 28 + 14 = 56 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine if a bulk discount applies:**\n   - The total amount of paint required is 56 gallons, which is more than 30 gallons.\n   - Therefore, the painter will receive a 10% bulk discount.\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost without discount:**\n   - One gallon of paint costs $35.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost without discount} = 56 \\text{ gallons} \\times \\$35/\\text{gallon}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost without discount} = 56 \\times 35 = \\$1960\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the discount amount:**\n   - The discount is 10%.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount} = 0.10 \\times \\$1960 = \\$196\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total cost with the discount:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost with discount} = \\$1960 - \\$196 = \\$1764\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the paint after applying the bulk discount is \\$1764."
