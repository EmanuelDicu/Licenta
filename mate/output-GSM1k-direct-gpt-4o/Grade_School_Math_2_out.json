Therefore, we need to find out how many guitar strings he breaks in a year.\n\\[\n\\text{Number of guitar strings in a year} = \\text{Number of weeks in a year} \\times \\text{Average number of strings broken per week}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Number of guitar strings in a year} = 52 \\times 3 = 156\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of replacing these guitar strings\nEach guitar string costs $3 to replace. Hence, we need to find out the total cost for 156 guitar strings.\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = \\text{Number of guitar strings in a year} \\times \\text{Cost per guitar string}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 156 \\times 3 = 468\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Present the final solution\nBernie spends a total of $468 on guitar strings over the course of an entire year.\n\n### Summary of solution:\n1. There are 52 weeks in a year.\n2. Bernie breaks an average of 3 strings per week, so he breaks 156 strings in a year.\n3. The cost to replace 156 strings, at $3 per string, is $468.\n\nThus, the solution to the problem is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{468}\n\\]"
