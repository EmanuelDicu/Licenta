Gabriella spends 40% of her money on the meat. She spends $5.00 less than one-third of the remaining money on heavy cream. Cauliflower costs three-fourth of the price of the heavy cream and the kale costs $2.00 less than the cauliflower. As Gabriela leaves the store, she spends one-third of her remaining money on her grandmother\u2019s favorite Girl Scout Cookies. How much money, in dollars, does Gabriela spend on Girl Scout cookies?",

Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Determine the amount spent on meat:**\n   Gabriela has $65. She spends 40% of her money on meat.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount spent on meat} = 0.40 \\times 65 = 26 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the remaining money after buying meat:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining money} = 65 - 26 = 39 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the amount spent on heavy cream:**\n   She spends $5.00 less than one-third of her remaining money on heavy cream.\n   \\[\n   \\text{One-third of remaining money} = \\frac{39}{3} = 13 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount spent on heavy cream} = 13 - 5 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the cost of cauliflower:**\n   Cauliflower costs three-fourths the price of the heavy cream.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of cauliflower} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 8 = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the cost of kale:**\n   The kale costs $2.00 less than the cauliflower.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of kale} = 6 - 2 = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the remaining money after buying the heavy cream, cauliflower, and kale:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total spent on cream, cauliflower, and kale} = 8 + 6 + 4 = 18 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining money} = 39 - 18 = 21 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Determine the amount spent on Girl Scout Cookies:**\n   Gabriela spends one-third of her remaining money on Girl Scout Cookies.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount spent on cookies} = \\frac{21}{3} = 7 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Gabriela spends $7.00 on Girl Scout Cookies."
