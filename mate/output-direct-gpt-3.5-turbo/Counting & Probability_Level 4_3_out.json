        "correct_solution": "The only way for the Dora to end up at her starting point in four steps is for her to traverse the four sides of the gray square.  She can do this in two ways: clockwise and counterclockwise. The probability of each of these two paths is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^4=\\frac{1}{256}$.  Therefore, the probability that she ends up where she started is $\\dfrac{1}{256}+\\dfrac{1}{256}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{128}}$.",

Determine all possible paths Dora can take in her first four steps to walk completely around the gray square.\n2. Calculate the total number of distinct paths of 4 steps from point $A$.\n3. Find the probability of Dora walking completely around the gray square in her first four steps.\n\nLet's solve each part step by step:\n\n1. **Possible Paths to Walk Around the Gray Square:**\n   Dora needs to walk completely around the gray square in 4 steps. To do this, she must make a clockwise or counterclockwise loop around the square. There are two ways she can do this:\n   - Starting from point $A$, she goes down, then right, then up, then left back to $A$.\n   - Starting from point A, she goes down, then left, then up, then right back to $A$.\n\n2. **Total Number of Distinct Paths of 4 Steps:**\n   Dora has 4 choices at each intersection, and she makes 4 steps in total. Therefore, the total number of distinct paths of 4 steps from point $A$ is $4^4 = 256$.\n\n3. **Probability of Walking Around the Gray Square:**\n   From the two possible paths to walk around the gray square, only one takes Dora around the square in 4 steps. So, the probability of Dora walking completely around the gray square in her first four steps is $\\frac{1}{256}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Dora will walk completely around the gray square in her first four steps is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{256}}$."
