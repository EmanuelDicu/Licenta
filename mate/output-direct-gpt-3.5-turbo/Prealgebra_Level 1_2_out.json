Let's denote these angles in relation to the straight line $PQ$. The angles can be identified as follows:\n\n- The angle at point $P$ is $x$.\n- The angle at the intersection of the two lines is also $x$.\n- The angle at point $Q$ is also $x$.\n\n2. **Understanding angles on a straight line**: When two lines form a straight line or are parallel, the sum of the interior angles on the same side of the transversal is always $180^\\circ$. In this case, the angles at $P$ and $Q$ are on the same side of the transversal, which is the straight line $PQ$.\n\n3. **Use the property of angles on a straight line**: Since the angles at $P$ and $Q$ are on the same side of the transversal and form a straight line, they add up to $180^\\circ$. This means:\n\\[ x + x = 180^\\circ \\]\n\\[ 2x = 180^\\circ \\]\n\n4. **Solve for x**: To find the value of $x$, we need to solve the equation we set up:\n\\[ 2x = 180^\\circ \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{180^\\circ}{2} \\]\n\\[ x = 90^\\circ \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ is $90^\\circ$."
