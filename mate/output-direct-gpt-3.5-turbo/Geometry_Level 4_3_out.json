Distance between $(-2, 2)$ and $(2, -2)$:\n   This can be calculated using the distance formula:\n   $d = \\sqrt{ (2 - (-2))^2 + (-2 - 2)^2}$\n   $d = \\sqrt{ 4^2 + (-4)^2 }$\n   $d = \\sqrt{ 16 + 16}$\n   $d = \\sqrt{ 32}$\n   $d = 4\\sqrt{2}$\n\n2. Distance between $(2, -2)$ and $(-2, -6)$:\n   Using the distance formula:\n   $d = \\sqrt{ (-2 - 2)^2 + (-6 - (-2))^2 }$\n   $d = \\sqrt{ (-4)^2 + (-6 + 2)^2 }$\n   $d = \\sqrt{ 16 + (-4)^2}$\n   $d = \\sqrt{ 16 + 16}$\n   $d = 4\\sqrt{2}$\n\n3. Distance between $(-2, -6)$ and $(-6, -2)$:\n   Using the distance formula:\n   $d = \\sqrt{ (-6 - (-2))^2 + (-2 - (-6))^2 }$\n   $d = \\sqrt{ (-6 + 2)^2 + (-2 + 6)^2 }$\n   $d = \\sqrt{ (-4)^2 + 4^2 }$\n   $d = \\sqrt{ 16 + 16 }$\n   $d = 4\\sqrt{2}$\n\nSince all the sides of a square are equal, we can see that all the sides of the square formed by these vertices have a length of $4\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the area of the square can be calculated using the formula for the area of a square:\n\nArea = Side length $\\times$ Side length\nArea = $(4\\sqrt{2})^2$\nArea = $4^2 \\times (\\sqrt{2})^2$\nArea = $16 \\times 2$\nArea = $32$ square units\n\nTherefore, the area of the square with the given vertices $(-2, 2), (2, -2), (-2, -6),$ and $(-6, -2)$ is $32$ square units."
