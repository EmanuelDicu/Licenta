The sum of the roots is given by $r+s+t = -\\frac{b}{a}$\n2. The sum of all possible products of the roots taken two at a time is given by $rs + rt + st = \\frac{c}{a}$\n3. The product of the roots is given by $rst = -\\frac{d}{a}$\n\nFirst, we identify the coefficients of the given equation $x^3 - 3x - 5 = 0.$\nFrom the equation, we have:\n$a = 1,$\n$b = 0,$\n$c = -3,$\nand $d = -5.$\n\nNext, we can use Vieta's formulas to find the value of $abc$.\n\n1. The sum of the roots $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ is given by:\n$a + b + c = -\\frac{b}{a}$\nSince $b = 0,$ this simplifies to:\n$a + b + c = a + c = 0$\nTherefore, $c = -a.$\n\n2. The sum of all possible products of the roots taken two at a time is given by $ab + ac + bc = \\frac{c}{a}$\nSubstitute $c = -a$:\n$ab + a(-a) + b(-a) = -a$\n$ab - a^2 = -a$\n$ab = a^2 - a$\n\n3. The product of the roots $abc$ is given by:\n$abc = -\\frac{d}{a}$\nSubstitute $d = -5$ and $a = 1$:\n$abc = 5$\n\nTherefore, the value of $abc$ is $\\boxed{5}$."
