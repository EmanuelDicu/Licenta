        "correct_solution": "Notice that for each integer $n$ satisfying $1 \\le n \\le 19, n \\neq 10$, then using the sum of cubes factorization, $n^3 + (20 - n)^3 = (n + 20 - n)(n^2 + (20-n)n + (20-n)^2)$ $ = 20(n^2 + (20-n)n + (20-n)^2)$. Thus, we can pair each integer with the difference between $20$ and that integer, and the sum of their cubes is divisible by $20$. Hence, the units digit of the sum of the first $19$ cubes, excluding $10$, is equal to $0$. Also, the units digits of $10^3$ and $20^3$ are clearly $0$, so we just need to find the units digit of the cube of $21$, which is $\\boxed{1}$.",

            "gpt-3.5-turbo": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts:\n\nPart 1: Finding the formula for the sum of the first $n$ perfect cubes. \nLet $S_n = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \\ldots + n^3 $ be the sum of the first $n$ perfect cubes. The formula for $S_n$ can be found using the formula for the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers, which is $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. Squaring this formula gives $\\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)^2$, which is equivalent to $S_n = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \\ldots + n^3 = \\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)^2$.\n\nPart 2: Finding the sum of the first $21$ perfect cubes.\nUsing the formula from Part 1, we can find that the sum of the first $21$ perfect cubes is $S_{21} = \\left(\\frac{21(21+1)}{2}\\right)^2 = 441^2 = 194481$.\n\nPart 3: Determining the units digit of the sum of the first $21$ perfect cubes.\nTo find the units digit of a number, we just look at the last digit. In this case, the units digit of $194481$ is $1$.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of the sum of the first $21$ positive perfect cubes is $\\boxed{1}$."
