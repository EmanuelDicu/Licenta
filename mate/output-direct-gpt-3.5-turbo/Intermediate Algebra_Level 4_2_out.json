Substitute $x = 0$ into the polynomial $f(x)$ to get the value of $s$, the constant term.\n\nFinally, proceed to Step 4:\n\nStep 4: Calculate $f(1)$ using the obtained polynomial.\nAfter finding the coefficients $p, q, r, s$ of the polynomial $f(x)$, substitute $x = 1$ into the polynomial to get the value of $f(1)$, which provides the solution to the problem.\n\nBy following these logical steps and solving the necessary equations, you will be able to find $f(1)$ as per the problem statement."
