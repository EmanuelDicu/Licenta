            "gpt-3.5-turbo": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts and tackle each part step by step. Here's how we can approach the problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to count the number of squares that have all four vertices on the 5 by 5 rectangular grid of dots.\n\n2. **Analyze the Types of Squares**: We can categorize the squares based on their sizes. The squares can have side lengths of 1 unit, 2 units, 3 units, or 4 units.\n\n3. **Counting Squares of Side Length 1**: On a 5 by 5 grid, there are 4 squares of side length 1 unit for each row and each column. So, there are a total of $4 \\times 4 = 16$ squares of side length 1 unit.\n\n4. **Counting Squares of Side Length 2**: Now, we can count the number of squares of side length 2 units. Consider each dot in the grid as the top-left corner of a 2 by 2 square. There are 16 such positions. For each of these positions, we can form a 2 by 2 square. So, there are 16 squares of side length 2 units.\n\n5. **Counting Squares of Side Length 3**: To count the number of squares of side length 3 units, we can consider each 3 by 3 square on the grid. There are 3 such squares in each row and each column. Therefore, there are $3 \\times 3 = 9$ squares of side length 3 units.\n\n6. **Counting Squares of Side Length 4**: Lastly, we consider the squares of side length 4 units. There is only one such square on the grid.\n\n7. **Summing Up**: Adding up the number of squares of each size, we get:  \n$16$ squares of side length 1 unit  \n$16$ squares of side length 2 units  \n$9$ squares of side length 3 units  \n$1$ square of side length 4 units\n\nTherefore, the total number of squares with all four vertices on the 5 by 5 rectangular grid of dots is $16 + 16 + 9 + 1 = 42$.\n\nSo, the solution to the problem is that there are 42 squares with all four vertices on the 5 by 5 rectangular grid."
