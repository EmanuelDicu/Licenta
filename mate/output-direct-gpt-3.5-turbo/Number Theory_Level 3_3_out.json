            "gpt-3.5-turbo": "To find the smallest whole number $b$ such that 47 can be expressed in base $b$ using only two digits, we can approach this problem by breaking it down into smaller parts:\n\n1. For any number to be represented in base $b$ using only two digits, the maximum value for each digit is $(b-1)$. This is because in base $b$, each place value can range from 0 to $(b-1)$.\n\n2. Let's express the number 47 in base $b$. This can be written as $4b + 7$.\n\n3. From the constraints mentioned earlier, we know that both 4 and 7 must be less than $b$, so $4 < b$ and $7 < b$.\n\n4. We can create an inequality from these conditions: $4b + 7 < b^2$. This inequality ensures that the number 47 can be represented in base $b$ using only two digits.\n\n5. Simplifying the inequality, we get $4b + 7 < b^2 \\Rightarrow b^2 - 4b - 7 > 0$.\n\n6. This is a quadratic inequality. We can solve it by finding the roots of the corresponding equation $b^2 - 4b - 7 = 0$.\n\n7. Using the quadratic formula, $b = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-7)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 28}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{44}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{11}}{2}$.\n\n8. The two possible solutions for $b$ are $b = 2 + \\sqrt{11}$ and $b = 2 - \\sqrt{11}$.\n\n9. We are looking for the smallest whole number $b$, so we consider the ceiling of $b = 2 + \\sqrt{11}$, which is $b = \\lceil2 + \\sqrt{11}\\rceil = \\lceil4.316\\dots\\rceil = 5$.\n\n10. Therefore, the smallest whole number $b$ such that 47 can be expressed in base $b$ using only two digits is 5.\n\nIn conclusion, the solution to the problem is that the smallest whole number $b$ is 5."
