        "correct_solution": "When an image is translated to the right we just add the number of units it is being translated to the original $x$-coordinate. When an image is translated down we just subtract that number of units from the $y$-coordinate. In this case we'll subtract 2 from the $y$-coordinates and add 3 to the   $x$-coordinates. This will make point $B(6, 5)$ move to $B'(6 + 3, 5 - 2) = \\boxed{(9, 3)}$.",

First, let's find the vector representing the translation that moves points 2 units down and 3 units to the right. Let's call this vector $\\vec{v}$.\n   \n   $\\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n2. Next, let's find the new coordinates of point B after the translation. We can do this by adding the translation vector $\\vec{v}$ to the original coordinates of point B.\n\n   New coordinates of B: $B'(6,5) + \\vec{v} = B'(6+3, 5-2) = B'(9,3)$\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the final image of point B after the translation will be $B'(9,3)$."
