Since $\\triangle AMB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle and $AB=6$, $AM=3\\sqrt{3}$. Since $AO$ is $2/3$ of $AM$, we have $AO=2\\sqrt{3}$.

Finding the radius of the circumscribed circle:\nSince the circle is circumscribed around an equilateral triangle, the center of the circle will be the circumcenter of the triangle. The circumcenter is the point where the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle's sides meet.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the circumcenter, centroid, and orthocenter coincide and divide the triangle into three smaller congruent triangles, each with a side length half of the equilateral triangle. Let's denote the side length of each of these smaller triangles as $3$ units.\n\nThe circumcenter of the equilateral triangle is equidistant from all three vertices. Therefore, the radius of the circumscribed circle is the distance from the circumcenter to any vertex of the equilateral triangle.\n\nUsing trigonometry, we can find that the height of the equilateral triangle is $\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ units, and the distance from the circumcenter to a vertex (which is also the radius of the circumscribed circle) is $\\frac{2}{3}$ times the height. Thus, the radius is $\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\sqrt{3}$ units.\n\n2. Calculating the area of the circle:\nThe area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.\n\nSubstitute the radius we found ($\\sqrt{3}$) into the formula:\n$A = \\pi \\times (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 3\\pi$ square units.\n\nTherefore, the area of the circle circumscribed about the equilateral triangle with side lengths of $6$ units each is $3\\pi$ square units."
