        "problem": "Billy shoots an arrow from 10 feet above the ground. The height of this arrow can be expressed by the equation $h=10-23t-10t^2$, where $t$ is time in seconds since the arrow was shot. If the center of a target is raised 5 feet off the ground, in how many seconds must the arrow reach the target in order for Billy to hit the bulls eye?",
        "correct_solution": "Since the center of the target is 5 feet above the ground, $h=5$. So we get the quadratic: \\begin{align*}5& =10-23t-10t^{2}\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 0& =10t^{2}+23t-5\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 0&=(2t+5)(5t-1).\n\\end{align*}Thus, the values of $t$ that satisfy the equation are $-\\frac52$ and $\\frac15$. However, since time can never be a negative number, the answer must be $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{5}}$.",

            "gpt-3.5-turbo": "To solve this problem, we will break it into smaller parts and solve them in logical order:\n\nStep 1: Determine the height of the target's bullseye relative to the ground:\n\nThe height of the target's bullseye from the ground is at a height of 10 feet (center of target) + 5 feet (raised target center) = 15 feet above the ground.\n\nStep 2: Set up the equation for when the arrow hits the bullseye:\n\nWe know that the height of the arrow at time $t$ is given by the function $h(t) = 10 - 23t - 10t^2$. \n\nWe want to find the time $t$ at which the height of the arrow equals the height of the bullseye. Therefore, we have:\n\n$10 - 23t - 10t^2 = 15$\n\nStep 3: Simplify the equation and solve for $t$:\n\n$-10t^2 - 23t + 10 = 15$\n\n$-10t^2 - 23t - 5 = 0$\n\nStep 4: Solve the quadratic equation:\n\nWe can solve the quadratic equation $-10t^2 - 23t - 5 = 0$ by using the quadratic formula:\n\n$t = \\frac{-(-23) \\pm \\sqrt{(-23)^2 - 4*(-10)*(-5)}}{2*(-10)}$\n\n$t = \\frac{23 \\pm \\sqrt{529 - 200}}{-20}$\n\n$t = \\frac{23 \\pm \\sqrt{329}}{-20}$\n\nStep 5: Calculate the actual values of $t$:\n\n$t_1 = \\frac{23 + \\sqrt{329}}{-20}$\n\n$t_2 = \\frac{23 - \\sqrt{329}}{-20}$\n\nTherefore, there are two possible times when the arrow could hit the bullseye: $t_1$ and $t_2$. \n\nThe times are approximately $t_1 \\approx -1.95$ seconds and $t_2 \\approx 0.25$ seconds. \n\nSince time cannot be negative in this context, we consider $t_2$ as the time when the arrow hits the bullseye.\n\nStep 6: Final check:\n\nTo check if our solution is correct, substitute $t = 0.25$ back into the original function:\n\n$h(0.25) = 10 - 23(0.25) - 10(0.25)^2$\n\n$h(0.25) = 10 - 5.75 - 0.625$\n\n$h(0.25) = 10 - 5.75 - 0.625$\n\n$h(0.25) = 3.625$\n\nSince the height of the arrow at time $t = 0.25$ seconds is equal to the height of the bullseye, our final answer is that Billy must hit the bullseye in approximately 0.25 seconds."
