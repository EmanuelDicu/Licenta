First, simplify the expression by solving the brackets:\n$4(1-4x)$\n$= 4(1) - 4(4x)$\n$= 4 - 16x$\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n$5x - 3x + 4 - 16x = 32$\n\n2. Next, combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n$5x - 3x - 16x + 4 = 32$\n$= (5 - 3 - 16)x + 4 = 32$\n$= -14x + 4 = 32$\n\n3. Now, isolate the variable $x$ by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation:\n$-14x + 4 = 32$\n$-14x = 32 - 4$\n$-14x = 28$\n\n4. Finally, solve for $x$ by dividing both sides by -14:\n$x = \\frac{28}{-14}$\n$x = -2$\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ in the equation $5x - 3x + 4(1-4x) = 32$ is $x = -2$."
