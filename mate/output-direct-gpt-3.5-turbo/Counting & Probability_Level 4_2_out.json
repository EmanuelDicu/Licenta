(So, for example, the probability of a 2 being rolled is twice that of a 1 being rolled.)  What is the expected value of a roll of this weighted die?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "correct_solution": "Let $x$ be the probability that a 1 is rolled.  Then the probability that a 2 is rolled is $2x$, the probability that a 3 is rolled is $3x$, and so on.  Since the sum of all these probabilities must be 1, we have that $x + 2x + \\cdots + 6x = 1$, which means that $21x = 1$, so $x = \\frac{1}{21}$.  Therefore \\[ E = \\frac{1}{21}(1) + \\frac{2}{21}(2) + \\cdots + \\frac{6}{21}(6) = \\frac{1^2 + 2^2 + \\cdots 6^2}{21} = \\boxed{\\frac{13}{3}}. \\]",

Find the total probability of rolling the die:  \nThe total probability of rolling any number on a fair 6-sided die is 1. However, since the probabilities on this weighted die are proportional to the value of the roll, we need to find the total probability for the weighted die.  \nTotal probability on weighted die = 1/1 + 2/2 + 3/3 + 4/4 + 5/5 + 6/6  \nTotal probability on weighted die = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6  \n\n2. Find the individual probabilities of rolling each number on the weighted die:  \nThe probabilities of rolling each number on the weighted die are proportional to the value of the roll.  \nProbability of rolling 1 = 1/6 of the total probability = 1/6  \nProbability of rolling 2 = 2/6 of the total probability = 1/3  \nProbability of rolling 3 = 3/6 of the total probability = 1/2  \nProbability of rolling 4 = 4/6 of the total probability = 2/3  \nProbability of rolling 5 = 5/6 of the total probability  \nProbability of rolling 6 = 6/6 of the total probability = 1  \n\n3. Find the expected value of rolling the weighted die:  \nExpected value is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability.  \nExpected value = 1 * 1/6 + 2 * 1/3 + 3 * 1/2 + 4 * 2/3 + 5 * 5/6 + 6 * 1  \nExpected value = 1/6 + 2/3 + 3/2 + 8/3 + 5 + 6  \nExpected value = 21/6 + 8/3 + 9/2  \nExpected value = 21/6 + 16/6 + 27/6  \nExpected value = 64/6  \nExpected value = 32/3  \n\nTherefore, the expected value of rolling this weighted die is 32/3."
