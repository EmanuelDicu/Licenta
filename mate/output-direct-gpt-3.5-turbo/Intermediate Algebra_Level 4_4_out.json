The prime factorization of 42 is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7.$  Furthermore, the product of the roots is $(-1)^n \\cdot \\frac{42}{a_0},$ where $n$ is the degree of the polynomial, and $a_0$ is the leading coefficient.\n\nTo maximize the number of integer roots, which must be distinct, we can take the integer roots to be 2, 3, 7, 1, and $-1.$  This gives us a maximum of $\\boxed{5}$ integer roots.",

            "gpt-3.5-turbo": "To solve this problem, we can approach it by considering the properties of polynomials with integer coefficients and integer roots.\n\nPart 1: Understanding the Relationship between Root and Coefficients in a Polynomial\n- In a polynomial with integer coefficients, the sum of the roots and the product of the roots are related to the coefficients through Vieta's formulas.\n- For a polynomial of degree n with coefficients $a_0, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and roots $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$, the following relationships hold:\n   - The sum of the roots: $x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n = -\\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}$\n   - The product of the roots: $x_1 \\cdot x_2 \\cdot ... \\cdot x_n = (-1)^n \\cdot \\frac{a_0}{a_n}$\n\nPart 2: Applying Vieta's Formulas to the Given Problem\n- In this problem, we are given that the constant coefficient (a0) is 42. Assuming the polynomial is of degree n, we have $a_0 = 42$.\n- We also know that all the roots are distinct integers. Let's denote the roots as $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$.\n- Since all the roots are integers, the product of the roots must be an integer. From Vieta's formulas, we have $(-1)^n \\cdot \\frac{a_0}{a_n}$ should be an integer.\n\nPart 3: Finding the Possible Values of n\n- We know that $\\frac{42}{a_n}$ must be an integer. Since 42 = 2 * 3 * 7, the possible values of n that make $\\frac{42}{a_n}$ an integer are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42.\n- However, since n represents the degree of the polynomial, n cannot be greater than the number of roots. Therefore, the possible values of n are 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7.\n\nPart 4: Determining the Number of Integer Roots\n- To maximize the number of integer roots, we aim to have n as large as possible. Since n cannot be greater than the number of roots, the largest possible number of integer roots is the maximum value of n that is less than or equal to 42, which is n = 7.\n- Therefore, the largest possible number of integer roots in the polynomial is 7.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is that the largest possible number of integer roots in the polynomial with integer coefficients and constant coefficient of 42 is 7."
