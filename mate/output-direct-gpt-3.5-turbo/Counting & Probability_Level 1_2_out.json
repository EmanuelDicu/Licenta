Determine the number of outcomes where Ben flips Head, Tail, Head, Tail in that specific order.\n\nLet's go through each part:\n\n1. Total number of outcomes when flipping a fair nickel four times:\nWhen flipping a coin, there are 2 possible outcomes - heads (H) and tails (T). Since Ben flips the nickel four times, the total number of outcomes is 2^4 = 16. These outcomes can be represented as: {HHHH, HHHT, HHTH, HHTT, HTHH, HTHT, HTTH, HTTT, THHH, THHT, THTH, THTT, TTHH, TTHT, TTTH, TTTT}.\n\n2. Number of outcomes where Ben flips Head, Tail, Head, Tail in that order:\nSince we are looking for the specific order of HTH, the number of outcomes where Ben flips Head, Tail, Head, Tail in that order is 1.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Ben flips Head, Tail, Head, Tail in that order is:\nNumber of successful outcomes / Total number of outcomes = 1 / 16 = 1/16.\n\nSo, the solution to the problem is that the probability that Ben flips Head, Tail, Head, Tail in that specific order is 1/16."
