        "correct_solution": "A number will be divisible by 11 if you get a multiple of 11 by alternately adding and then subtracting its digits.  If we name the blank integer $A$, then the alternating sum is $2 - 0 + A - 7 = A -5$.  This value can only be equal to 0 (as 11, 22, etc all yield $A$ that are too large), so $A = \\boxed{5}$ is the only digit that will work.",

            "gpt-3.5-turbo": "To solve this problem, we can use the rule for divisibility by 11. For a number to be divisible by 11, the difference between the sum of the digits at odd positions and the sum of the digits at even positions must be either 0 or a multiple of 11.\n\nLet's first find the sum of digits at odd and even positions in the number $20\\_7$.\n\n- Sum of digits at odd positions: 2 + \\_ = 2 + digit\n- Sum of digits at even positions: 0 + 7 = 7\n\nNow, to make the number $20_$ divisible by 11, we need to find the digit that replaces the blank such that the difference between the sum of digits at odd positions and the sum of digits at even positions is 0 or a multiple of 11.\n\nLet's express this as an equation:\n(2 + digit) - 7 = 0 or (2 + digit) - 7 = 11n, where n is an integer.\n\nSolving the first equation:\n2 + digit = 7\ndigit = 5\n\nTherefore, the digit that must be placed in the blank to make the four-digit integer $20\\_7$ a multiple of 11 is 5."
