To do this, we can add 13r to both sides:\n-13r + 13r > 4r + 13r\n0 > 17r\n\n5. **Simplify the inequality**:\nNow we have simplified the inequality to 0 > 17r, which simplifies further to 0 > r.\n\n6. **Express the solution in interval notation**:\nSince r is greater than 0, we can express the solution as an interval:\nr \u2208 (0, \u221e)\n\nSo, the solution to the inequality -13(r+5) + 25 > 4(r-10) is r \u2208 (0, \u221e)."
