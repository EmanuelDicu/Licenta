        "correct_solution": "For there to be infinite solutions, the first equation needs to be consistent with the second and yet add no new information, which means it must be a multiple of the second. Since the coefficient of $y$ in the first equation is twice that of $y$ in the second equation, the multiplier is 2. This implies that the first equation must be $2(5x+y)=2(-3)$. After equating coefficients, this gives $2a=2\\cdot5$ and $b=2\\cdot-3$, or $(a,b)=\\boxed{(5,-6)}$.",

This implies that the slope of the first equation ($-a$) is equal to the slope of the second equation ($-5$). Therefore, $a = 5$. \n\nSubstitute $a = 5$ into equation $(1)$:\n$10x - 10x = b + 6 \\\\\n0 = b + 6 \\\\\nb = -6.$\n\nTherefore, the ordered pair $(a,b)$ for which there are infinite solutions to the system is $(5, -6)$."
