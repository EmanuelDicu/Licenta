        "correct_solution": "Let $x$ represent the length of each of the edges. If we draw the diagonal $\\overline{BD}$, we create the right triangle $BCD$. Since $\\overline{BC}\\cong\\overline{DC}$, $\\triangle BCD$ is a 45-45-90 right triangle, which means the hypotenuse has a length of $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of each leg. So $BD=x\\sqrt{2}$. Since $\\triangle ABD$ is an isosceles triangle, we know that drawing a segment from $A$ to the midpoint of $\\overline{BD}$ splits the triangles into two congruent right triangles. Each right triangle has a hypotenuse of length $x$ and a leg of length $\\frac{BD}{2}=\\frac{x\\sqrt{2}}{2}=\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Notice that the hypotenuse has a length of $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of the bottom leg, which means the triangle is another 45-45-90 right triangle.

            "gpt-3.5-turbo": "To find the degree measure of angle $ABD$, we can break down the problem into the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Understand the geometry of the pyramid:\n- In a right pyramid with a square base, the apex (vertex) is directly above the center of the square base. Each of the triangular faces meets the base at a single edge, which is called the slant height.\n- In the given diagram, $ABCD$ is the square base of the pyramid. $E$ is the apex of the pyramid.\n\nStep 2: Find the measure of angle $ADE$:\n- Triangle $ADE$ is a right triangle with $AE$ as the altitude of the pyramid.\n- Since all edges of the pyramid are of the same length, $ADE$ is an isosceles right triangle, making angles $AED$ and $ADE$ equal.\n- The angles of a right triangle are $90^\\circ, 45^\\circ,$ and $45^\\circ$.\n- Therefore, angle $ADE = 45^\\circ$.\n\nStep 3: Find the measure of angle $BAD$:\n- To find angle $BAD$, we need to consider the triangle $BAD$.\n- Tanget to plane $BCD$ passing through $A$ will be perpendicular to $BCD$, which helps in computing the angle $BAD$.\n- In general terms, for any pyramid, the angle formed between the face of the pyramid and the base at the apex is the same as the angle formed between the side edge and the base at the base vertex.\n- Angle $BAD$ is $45^\\circ$.\n\nStep 4: Find the angle $ABD$:\n- Since angles $ADE$ and $ABD$ are equal, we have $m\\angle ABD = m\\angle ADE = 45^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, the degree measure of angle $ABD$ is $\\boxed{45^\\circ}$."
