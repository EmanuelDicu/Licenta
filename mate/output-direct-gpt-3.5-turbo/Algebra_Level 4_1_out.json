Use the quadratic formula to find $y$.\nThe quadratic formula is given by $y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=1$, $b=-1$, and $c=-x$.\n\nStep 5: Substitute $a=1$, $b=-1$, and $c=-x$ into the quadratic formula to find the two possible values of $y$.\n$y = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4x}}{2}$.\n\nStep 6: Since the expression inside the square root must be non-negative for real solutions, we will take the positive solution of $y$.\nTherefore, $y = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 + 4x}}{2}$.\n\nStep 7: Given that $y=5$, we can substitute $y=5$ into the equation to find $x$.\n$\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 + 4x}}{2} = 5$.\n\nStep 8: Solve for $x$ by rearranging the equation and squaring both sides to eliminate the square root.\n$1 + \\sqrt{1 + 4x} = 10$,\n$\\sqrt{1 + 4x} = 9$,\n$1 + 4x = 81$,\n$4x = 80$,\n$x = 20$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ for which $\\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + \\ldots}}} = 5$ is $x = 20$."
