        "correct_solution": "For a circle of radius $r$ and an arc of $\\theta$ degrees, the arc length is $(2\\pi r)\\frac{\\theta}{360}$. Thus, for the same arc length, the arc angle is inversely proportional to the radius, so the ratio of the radius of circle $A$ to the radius of circle $B$ is $40:55$, or $8:11$. Since the ratio of the areas of two circles is the square of the ratio of their radii, the ratio of the area of circle $A$ to the area of circle $B$ is $(8/11)^2=\\boxed{\\frac{64}{121}}$.",

Use the circumference to find the radius of each circle.\n3. Use the radius to find the area of each circle.\n4. Find the ratio of the areas of circle $A$ to circle $B$.\n\nLet's go step by step:\n\n1. The formula to find the circumference of a circle is $C = 2\\pi r$, where $C$ is the circumference and $r$ is the radius. Given that the arc of $55$ degrees on circle $A$ has the same length as the arc of $40$ degrees on circle $B$, we can set up the following equation:\n\n$55^\\circ$ on circle $A$: $55^\\circ = \\frac{55}{360} \\times C_A$\n$40^\\circ$ on circle $B$: $40^\\circ = \\frac{40}{360} \\times C_B$\n\nSimplify these equations to find the relationship between the circumferences of the two circles.\n\n$55 = \\frac{55}{360} \\times C_A$\n$40 = \\frac{40}{360} \\times C_B$\n\n2. Solve for $C_A$ and $C_B$:\n$C_A = \\frac{360}{55} \\times 55 = 360$\n$C_B = \\frac{360}{40} \\times 40 = 360$\n\n3. Use the formula $C = 2\\pi r$ to find the radius of each circle:\nFor circle $A$: $360 = 2\\pi r_A \\Rightarrow r_A = \\frac{360}{2\\pi} = 180/\\pi$\nFor circle $B$: $360 = 2\\pi r_B \\Rightarrow r_B = \\frac{360}{2\\pi} = 180/\\pi$\n\n4. Find the area of each circle using the formula $A = \\pi r^2$:\nFor circle $A$: $A_A = \\pi \\left(\\frac{180}{\\pi}\\right)^2 = 180^2/\\pi$\nFor circle $B$: $A_B = \\pi \\left(\\frac{180}{\\pi}\\right)^2 = 180^2/\\pi$\n\n5. Finally, find the ratio of the areas of circle $A$ to circle $B$:\n$\\frac{A_A}{A_B} = \\frac{180^2/\\pi}{180^2/\\pi} = 1$\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the area of circle $A$ to the area of circle $B$ is $\\boxed{1}$."
