            "gpt-3.5-turbo": "Let's solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller parts in a logical order:\n\n1. **Determine the length of sides $AB$ and $AC$**:\n- Since $AK$ is the altitude of the triangle, $BK$ and $CK$ are also altitudes to the triangles $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle AKC$ respectively.\n- Let's denote $AB = x$ and $AC = y$.\n- Using the formula for the area of a triangle (Area = 0.5 * base * height), we can calculate the area of $\\triangle ABC$ in two ways:\n  - From $\\triangle ABC$: $Area_{ABC} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times x \\times 6$\n  - From $\\triangle AKC$: $Area_{ABC} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times y \\times 6$\n- Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get $3x = 3y$, which simplifies to $x = y$.\n- So, $AB = AC = x = y$.\n\n2. **Calculate the sides of the triangle**:\n- Now we know that $AB = AC = x = y$. Let's find the values of $AB$ and $AC$.\n- Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangles $\\triangle AKB$ and $\\triangle AKC$:\n  - In $\\triangle AKB$: $AB^2 = AK^2 + BK^2 = 6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100 \\implies AB = 10$.\n  - In $\\triangle AKC$: $AC^2 = AK^2 + CK^2 = 6^2 + 6^2 = 36 + 36 = 72 \\implies AC = \\sqrt{72} = 6\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n3. **Find the perimeter of the triangle**:\n- The perimeter of the triangle $\\triangle ABC$ is $AB + AC + BC = 10 + 6\\sqrt{2} + 14 = 24 + 6\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the triangle $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\boxed{24 + 6\\sqrt{2}}$."
