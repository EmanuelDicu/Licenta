Using the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:\n\n\\[ \\frac{a}{1 - r} = 45 \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( r = -1/2 \\) into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\frac{a}{1 - (-1/2)} = 45 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{a}{1 + 1/2} = 45 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{a}{3/2} = 45 \\]\n\n2. To solve for \\( a \\), multiply both sides by \\( 3/2 \\):\n\n\\[ a = 45 \\times \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\\[ a = 67.5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the first term of the infinite geometric series is 67.5."
