So, there are 7 ways to choose the Vice-President.\n\nStep 3: Choosing the Treasurer\nAfter selecting the President and Vice-President, the Treasurer will be the only person left, so there is only 1 way to choose the Treasurer.\n\nNow, to find the total number of ways to choose the President, Vice-President, and Treasurer, we multiply the number of ways for each step:\nTotal ways = (Number of ways to choose the President) x (Number of ways to choose the Vice-President) x (Number of ways to choose the Treasurer)\nTotal ways = 8 * 7 * 1\nTotal ways = 56\n\nTherefore, there are 56 ways to choose a President, Vice-President, and Treasurer from a group of 8 people if no one can serve two roles at the same time."
