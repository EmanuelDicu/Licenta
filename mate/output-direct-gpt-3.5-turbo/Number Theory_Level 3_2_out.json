This is equivalent to solving the congruence $7n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{398}$.\n\n**Part 3: Solve the congruence equation:**\nTo solve the congruence $7n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{398}$, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or trial and error method.\n\n**Part 4: Find the solution:**\nSolving the congruence $7n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{398}$, we find that $n=227$ is the solution. \nTherefore, the integer $227$ is a multiplicative inverse to 7 modulo 398. \n\nSo, the solution to the problem is $n=227$."
