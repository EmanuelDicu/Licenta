        "correct_solution": "The constant term of the product of two polynomials is just the product of the two constant terms. Therefore we know that $6=-2a$, so $a=-3$. We now consider the linear term of the product of our polynomials. It's given by $-16t=(5t\\cdot-2)+a\\cdot bt\\Longrightarrow-16t=-10t+(-3)bt\\Longrightarrow b=2$. Therefore our answer is $a+b=\\boxed{-1}$.",

Coefficients of $t^4$ term on both sides:\n   Left Side: coefficient = 12\n   Right Side: coefficient = 12\n   Equation: $3b=0$ (as there is no $t^4$ term on the Right Side)\n   Therefore, $b=0$\n\n2. Coefficients of $t^3$ term on both sides:\n   Left Side: coefficient = 23\n   Right Side: coefficient = 26\n   Equation: $3a+5b=0$\n   Substituting the value of $b=0$, we get: $3a=0$\n   Therefore, $a=0$\n\nThus, $a=0$ and $b=0$.\n\nFinally, we need to find $a+b$:\n$a+b = 0 + 0 = 0$\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is $a+b = 0$."
