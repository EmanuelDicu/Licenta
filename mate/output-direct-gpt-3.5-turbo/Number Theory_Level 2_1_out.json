        "correct_solution": "Note that for $n\\geq 2$, the last two digits of $5^n$ are 25.  To prove this, note that $5^2\\equiv 25 \\pmod{100}$, and whenever $5^{n-1}\\equiv 25\\pmod{100}$, we also have $5^n=5\\cdot 5^{n-1}\\equiv 5\\cdot 25 \\equiv 125 \\equiv 25 \\pmod{100}$. Thus the tens digit of $5^{2005}$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",

We will start by calculating the tens digit for a few lower powers of 5 to identify a pattern.\n    - \\(5^1 = 5\\) (tens digit: 0)\n    - \\(5^2 = 25\\) (tens digit: 2)\n    - \\(5^3 = 125\\) (tens digit: 2)\n    - \\(5^4 = 625\\) (tens digit: 2)\n    - \\(5^5 = 3125\\) (tens digit: 2)\n    \n    From the pattern observed above, we can see that most powers of 5 taken to larger exponents \\(>1\\) end in the tens digit of 2. \n    \n2. **Understanding the cyclical nature of tens digits:**\n    - Next, we need to understand the cyclical nature of the tens digit of powers of 5.\n    - The tens digit of powers of 5 repeat in cycles of 20.\n    - For example, consider that for powers of 5 starting from \\(5^1\\), the tens digits are as follows: 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...\n    - This pattern repeats every 20 powers of 5.\n\n3. **Calculating the position of \\(5^{2005}\\) in the cycle:**\n    - To find the tens digit of \\(5^{2005}\\), we need to determine the position of \\(5^{2005}\\) in the cycle of 20.\n    - \\(2005 \\div 20 = 100\\) with a remainder of 5.\n    - Since the cycle of 20 repeats, we are interested in the position 5 within the cycle. \n    \n4. **Determining the tens digit of \\(5^{2005}\\):**\n    - From our observations in step 1, we saw that the tens digit for most powers of 5 is 2.\n    - Since the position of \\(5^{2005}\\) falls on the tens digit of 2 in the cycle, the tens digit of \\(5^{2005}\\) is also 2.\n\nTherefore, the tens digit of \\(5^{2005}\\) is $\\boxed{2}$."
