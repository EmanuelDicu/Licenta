Determine the total number of ways to choose a 3-person committee from 8 people:\nTo choose a committee of 3 people from a group of 8, we need to calculate the combination of 8 people taken 3 at a time. This can be calculated using the formula for combinations: \n${8 \\choose 3} = \\frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \\frac{8!}{3!5!} = \\frac{8*7*6}{3*2*1} = 56$.\nSo, there are 56 ways to choose a 3-person committee from 8 people.\n\n2. Provide additional insights:\nWhen choosing a committee, the order in which the people are selected does not matter, which is why combinations are used instead of permutations. In this case, we are interested in selecting 3 people out of 8, and not the specific order in which they are selected.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is that there are 56 ways to choose a 3-person committee from a group of 8 people."
