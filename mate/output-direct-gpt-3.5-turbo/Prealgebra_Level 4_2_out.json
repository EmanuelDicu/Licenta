        "correct_solution": "Instead of adding up scores and figuring out the new averages, a quicker way (useful for the countdown round) is as follows:\n\nSince the average is 90, we first calculate how many points below 90 he already is: he's scored 87, 85, and 87, meaning that he is 3, 5, and 3 points below 90 respectively, making for a total of 11 points below.  We then know that his remaining two tests must be a combined 11 points above 90, and since they differ by 3 points, we know that one test is 4 above 90, and the other is 7 above 90, meaning his highest score was $\\boxed{97}$.",

            "gpt-3.5-turbo": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them step by step:\n\n1. Find the total points Ed scored on the first three tests:\n   Ed scored 87 + 85 + 87 = 259 points on the first three tests.\n\n2. Let's denote the scores of the last two tests as $x$ and $x+3$, where $x$ is the lower score. So, the total points Ed scored on the last two tests are $x + (x + 3) = 2x + 3$ points.\n\n3. Find the total points Ed scored on all five tests:\n   The total points Ed scored on all five tests are 259 (first three tests) + 2x + 3 (last two tests) = 259 + 2x + 3.\n\n4. As Ed has a $90\\%$ average on all five tests, we can calculate the total points he earned out of the 500 possible points:\n   $90\\% \\text{ of } 500 = 0.9 \\times 500 = 450$ points.\n\n5. Set up an equation based on the total points Ed scored on all five tests and the total points needed to achieve a $90\\%$ average:\n   $259 + 2x + 3 = 450$.\n\n6. Solve the equation to find the value of $x:\n   $2x + 262 = 450$\n   $2x = 450 - 262$\n   $2x = 188$\n   $x = 94$.\n\n7. So, the lower score on the last two tests is $94$ points. Therefore, the higher score is $94 + 3 = 97$ points.\n\nTherefore, Ed's highest test score was $\\boxed{97}$ points."
