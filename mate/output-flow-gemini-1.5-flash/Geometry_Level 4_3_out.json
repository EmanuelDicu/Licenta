This will help you visualize the square. \n\n2. **Find the Side Length:** Notice that the square is tilted.  We can find the side length by calculating the distance between two adjacent vertices. Let's take the vertices (-2, 2) and (2, -2). \n\n* **Use the Distance Formula:** The distance formula is \u221a((x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2).\n* **Plug in the coordinates:** \u221a((2 - (-2))\u00b2 + (-2 - 2)\u00b2) \n* **Simplify:** \u221a((4)\u00b2 + (-4)\u00b2) = \u221a(16 + 16) = \u221a32 = 4\u221a2 \n\n3. **Calculate the Area:** The area of a square is side length squared.\n* **Area = (side length)\u00b2 = (4\u221a2)\u00b2 = 16 * 2 = 32**\n\n**Therefore, the area of the square is  \\boxed{32} square units.**"
