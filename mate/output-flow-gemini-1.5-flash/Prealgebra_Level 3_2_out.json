So, we have 7 options for Vice-President.\n\n3. **Choosing the Treasurer:** With the President and Vice-President chosen, we have 6 people remaining.  Therefore, we have 6 options for Treasurer.\n\n4. **Total Combinations:** To find the total number of ways to choose the three positions, we multiply the number of options at each step: 8 * 7 * 6 = 336.\n\n**Answer:** There are $\\boxed{336}$ ways to choose a President, Vice-President, and Treasurer from a group of 8 people."
