The area of the larger circle is $\\pi (13)^2 = 169\\pi$, and the area of the smaller of the two larger circles is $\\pi (12)^2 = 144\\pi$.  Therefore, the area of the ring is $169\\pi - 144\\pi = 25\\pi$.\n\n**Step 2:  Set the area of the ring equal to the area of the smallest circle.**\n\nLet the radius of the smallest circle be $r$.  The area of the smallest circle is $\\pi r^2$.  We are given that the area of the ring is equal to the area of the smallest circle, so we have the equation:\n\n$$\\pi r^2 = 25\\pi$$\n\n**Step 3: Solve for the radius, r.**\n\nDivide both sides of the equation by $\\pi$:\n\n$$r^2 = 25$$\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\n$$r = \\boxed{5}$$\n\nTherefore, the radius of the smallest circle is $\\boxed{5}$."
