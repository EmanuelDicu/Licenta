These numbers are $-36$ and $-5$.  So, we can factor the equation as:\n\n$$(6t - 5)(t - 6) = 0$$\n\n**Step 3: Solve for the roots (solutions) of the equation.**\n\nFor the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of them must be zero.  Therefore, we have:\n\n* $6t - 5 = 0  \\Rightarrow t = \\frac{5}{6}$\n* $t - 6 = 0  \\Rightarrow t = 6$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the difference between the solutions.**\n\nThe difference between the solutions is $6 - \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{31}{6}$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the positive difference.**\n\nSince the difference is already positive, we don't need to change anything.\n\n**Final Answer:** The positive difference between the solutions is $\\boxed{\\frac{31}{6}}$."
