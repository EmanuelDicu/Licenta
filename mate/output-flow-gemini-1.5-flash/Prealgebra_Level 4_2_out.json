        "correct_solution": "Instead of adding up scores and figuring out the new averages, a quicker way (useful for the countdown round) is as follows:\n\nSince the average is 90, we first calculate how many points below 90 he already is: he's scored 87, 85, and 87, meaning that he is 3, 5, and 3 points below 90 respectively, making for a total of 11 points below.  We then know that his remaining two tests must be a combined 11 points above 90, and since they differ by 3 points, we know that one test is 4 above 90, and the other is 7 above 90, meaning his highest score was $\\boxed{97}$.",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "## Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the total points needed for a 90% average:** Since each test is worth 100 points, a 90% average across five tests means Ed needs a total of 0.90 * 5 * 100 = 450 points.\n\n2. **Calculate the total points from the first three tests:** Ed scored 87 + 85 + 87 = 259 points on the first three tests.\n\n3. **Calculate the total points needed from the last two tests:** To reach a 450-point total, Ed needs 450 - 259 = 191 points from the last two tests.\n\n4. **Represent the last two test scores algebraically:** Let 'x' be the score on Ed's higher of the last two tests. Since the scores differ by three points, the lower score is 'x - 3'.\n\n5. **Set up an equation to represent the total points from the last two tests:** The sum of the scores from the last two tests should equal 191 points: x + (x - 3) = 191.\n\n6. **Solve the equation:**  \n   * Combine like terms: 2x - 3 = 191\n   * Add 3 to both sides: 2x = 194\n   * Divide both sides by 2: x = 97\n\n7. **Determine the highest score:** The highest of Ed's last two scores is represented by 'x', so his highest test score is **97**.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \\boxed{97}"
