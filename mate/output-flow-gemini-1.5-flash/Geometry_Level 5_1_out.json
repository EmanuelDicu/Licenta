        "correct_solution": "For a circle of radius $r$ and an arc of $\\theta$ degrees, the arc length is $(2\\pi r)\\frac{\\theta}{360}$. Thus, for the same arc length, the arc angle is inversely proportional to the radius, so the ratio of the radius of circle $A$ to the radius of circle $B$ is $40:55$, or $8:11$. Since the ratio of the areas of two circles is the square of the ratio of their radii, the ratio of the area of circle $A$ to the area of circle $B$ is $(8/11)^2=\\boxed{\\frac{64}{121}}$.",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "Let the radius of circle $A$ be $r_A$ and the radius of circle $B$ be $r_B$.  The length of the 55-degree arc on circle $A$ is $\\frac{55}{360} \\cdot 2 \\pi r_A = \\frac{11}{72} \\pi r_A$, and the length of the 40-degree arc on circle $B$ is $\\frac{40}{360} \\cdot 2 \\pi r_B = \\frac{1}{9} \\pi r_B$.  Since these lengths are equal, we have\n\\[\\frac{11}{72} \\pi r_A = \\frac{1}{9} \\pi r_B.\\]Dividing both sides by $\\pi$ and multiplying both sides by 72, we get $11r_A = 8r_B$, so $r_A/r_B = 8/11$.\n\nThe ratio of the area of circle $A$ to the area of circle $B$ is\n\\[\\frac{\\pi r_A^2}{\\pi r_B^2} = \\left( \\frac{r_A}{r_B} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{8}{11} \\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\frac{64}{121}}.\\]"
