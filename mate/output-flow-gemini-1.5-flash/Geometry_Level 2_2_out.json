        "correct_solution": "When an image is translated to the right we just add the number of units it is being translated to the original $x$-coordinate. When an image is translated down we just subtract that number of units from the $y$-coordinate. In this case we'll subtract 2 from the $y$-coordinates and add 3 to the   $x$-coordinates. This will make point $B(6, 5)$ move to $B'(6 + 3, 5 - 2) = \\boxed{(9, 3)}$.",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Understand the translation:**  A translation down 2 units means we subtract 2 from the y-coordinate, and right 3 units means we add 3 to the x-coordinate.\n\n2. **Apply the translation to point B:** Point B has coordinates (6, 5).  After the translation, the new coordinates will be:\n\n   * x-coordinate: 6 + 3 = 9\n   * y-coordinate: 5 - 2 = 3\n\n3. **The final image of point B:** The final image of point B will have coordinates **(9, 3).**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{(9,3)}$."
