        "correct_solution": "The only way for the Dora to end up at her starting point in four steps is for her to traverse the four sides of the gray square.  She can do this in two ways: clockwise and counterclockwise. The probability of each of these two paths is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^4=\\frac{1}{256}$.  Therefore, the probability that she ends up where she started is $\\dfrac{1}{256}+\\dfrac{1}{256}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{128}}$.",

This means she must move in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.  \n* The only possible paths that achieve this are:\n    * **Clockwise:** Right, Down, Left, Up\n    * **Counterclockwise:** Left, Up, Right, Down\n\n**2. Calculate the total possible paths:**\n\n* At each intersection, Dora has 4 choices.\n* She takes 4 steps.\n* Therefore, the total number of possible paths is 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 256\n\n**3. Calculate the probability:**\n\n* There are 2 successful paths (clockwise and counterclockwise).\n* The probability of taking a successful path is the number of successful paths divided by the total number of paths: 2/256\n\n**4. Simplify the fraction:**\n\n* The probability can be simplified to **1/128**.\n\n**Final Answer:**  The probability that Dora will walk completely around the gray square in her first four steps is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{128}}$."
