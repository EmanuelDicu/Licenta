Note that the letter 'T' appears twice.\n\n**Step 2:  Calculate the factorial of the total number of letters**\n\nThe total number of letters is 4. The factorial of 4 (denoted as 4!) is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.\n\n**Step 3:  Account for repeated letters**\n\nSince the letter 'T' repeats twice, we need to divide the result from step 2 by the factorial of the number of times it repeats.  The factorial of 2 (denoted as 2!) is 2 * 1 = 2.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final number of arrangements**\n\nDivide the result from step 2 by the result from step 3: 24 / 2 = 12\n\n**Final Answer:** There are **\\boxed{12}** ways to arrange the letters of the word \"THAT\"."
