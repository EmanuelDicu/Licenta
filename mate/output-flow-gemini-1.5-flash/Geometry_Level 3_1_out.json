            "gemini-1.5-flash": "## Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Visualize the problem:** Imagine a sphere perfectly fitting inside a cube, touching all six faces. The diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube.\n\n2. **Find the radius of the sphere:**  We know the volume of the sphere is  $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$ cubic inches. The formula for the volume of a sphere is  $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, where 'r' is the radius. Let's plug in the given volume and solve for 'r':\n\n   $\\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$\n\n   Dividing both sides by $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$:\n\n   $\\frac{1}{8} = r^3$\n\n   Taking the cube root of both sides:\n\n   $r = \\frac{1}{2}$ inch\n\n3. **Find the side length of the cube:** Since the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube, and the diameter is twice the radius, the side length of the cube is 1 inch.\n\n4. **Calculate the volume of the cube:** The volume of a cube is given by  $V = s^3$, where 's' is the side length. Plugging in the side length:\n\n   $V = 1^3 = 1$ cubic inch.\n\n## Final Answer:\n\nThe volume of the cube is $\\boxed{1}$ cubic inch."
