            "gemini-1.5-flash": "**Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify corresponding angles:** Since $\\overline{BC}$ is parallel to the segment through $A$, the angle at $A$ and the angle at $B$ are corresponding angles. \n\n2. **Corresponding angles are equal:** Corresponding angles formed by parallel lines are equal.  Therefore, the angle at $B$ also measures $124^\\circ$.\n\n3. **Isosceles triangle:**  Since $AB = BC$, triangle $ABC$ is an isosceles triangle.\n\n4. **Base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal:** The base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal.  Therefore, the angle at $C$ also measures $124^\\circ$.\n\n5. **Angle sum of a triangle:** The angles inside a triangle add up to $180^\\circ$.\n\n6. **Calculate x:**  We can now solve for $x$: \n   $x^\\circ + 124^\\circ + 124^\\circ = 180^\\circ$\n   $x^\\circ = 180^\\circ - 124^\\circ - 124^\\circ = -68^\\circ$\n\n7. **Adjust for a valid angle:** Since angles are typically measured between $0^\\circ$ and $180^\\circ$, we need to adjust our answer.  Since the angle is supplementary to the $124^\\circ$ angle, the correct value of $x$ is  $180^\\circ - 68^\\circ = \\boxed{112^\\circ}$."
