        "correct_solution": "If $a_n =an + b$ and $b_n = cn + d$ are two arithmetic sequences, then their term-wise product takes the form \\[a_nb_n = (an+b)(cn+d) = An^2 + Bn + C,\\]where $A, B, C$ are constants. Therefore, some sequence $x_n = An^2 + Bn + C$ has $x_0 = 1440,$ $x_1 = 1716,$ and $x_2 = 1848.$ Then we have the equations \\[\\begin{aligned} C &= 1440, \\\\ A+B+C&=1716,\\\\  4A+2B+C&=1848. \\end{aligned}\\]Subtracting $C=1440$ from the second and third equations, we have $A+B=276$ and $4A+2B=408,$ or $2A+B=204.$ Then \\[A = (2A+B) - (A+B) = 204 - 276 = -72,\\]and so $B = 276-A=348.$ We conclude that the given sequence has the general formula \\[x_n = -72n^2 + 348n + 1440.\\]Then the eighth term is \\[\\begin{aligned} x_7 &= -72 \\cdot 7^2 + 348 \\cdot 7 + 1440 = \\boxed{348}. \\end{aligned}\\]",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "## Step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Analyze the differences:** The differences between consecutive terms of the given sequence are 276, 132, and so on.  The greatest common factor (GCD) of 276 and 132 is 12. This suggests that the common differences of the two arithmetic sequences must be factors of 12. \n\n2. **Find possible common differences:** Since the common differences must be factors of 12, let's consider the possibilities:\n    * **Sequence 1:** Common difference of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12\n    * **Sequence 2:** Common difference of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12\n\n3. **Test different combinations:** We need to find two common differences that multiply to 276 (the difference between the first two terms) and also result in a difference of 132 (the difference between the second and third terms).  Let's test some combinations:\n\n    * **Case 1:** If the common difference of the first sequence is 12, the common difference of the second sequence must be 23 (since 12 x 23 = 276).  However, this combination does not lead to a difference of 132 between the second and third terms.\n\n    * **Case 2:** If the common difference of the first sequence is 6, the common difference of the second sequence must be 46 (since 6 x 46 = 276). This combination also doesn't lead to a difference of 132.\n\n    * **Case 3:** If the common difference of the first sequence is 4, the common difference of the second sequence must be 69 (since 4 x 69 = 276). This also doesn't work.\n\n    * **Case 4:** If the common difference of the first sequence is 3, the common difference of the second sequence must be 92 (since 3 x 92 = 276). This combination doesn't work either.\n\n    * **Case 5:** If the common difference of the first sequence is 2, the common difference of the second sequence must be 138 (since 2 x 138 = 276). This combination also doesn't work.\n\n    * **Case 6:** If the common difference of the first sequence is 1, the common difference of the second sequence must be 276 (since 1 x 276 = 276). This also doesn't work.\n\n4. **Try different order:** Since none of the above cases worked, let's switch the order of the common differences:\n\n    * **Case 1:** If the common difference of the first sequence is 23, the common difference of the second sequence must be 12 (since 23 x 12 = 276). This does lead to a difference of 132 between the second and third terms, since 23 + 12 = 35, and 35 x 12 = 420, and 276 + 420 = 696, and 696 - 564 = 132.\n\n5. **Determine the arithmetic sequences:** \n\n    * **Sequence 1:** 1440, 1463, 1486, 1509, ... (Common difference 23)\n    * **Sequence 2:** 100, 112, 124, 136, ... (Common difference 12)\n\n6. **Calculate the eighth terms:**\n\n    * The eighth term of the first sequence is 1440 + 7(23) = 1601.\n    * The eighth term of the second sequence is 100 + 7(12) = 184.\n\n7. **Calculate the eighth term of the given sequence:** The eighth term of the given sequence is 1601 x 184 = **\\boxed{294584}**."
