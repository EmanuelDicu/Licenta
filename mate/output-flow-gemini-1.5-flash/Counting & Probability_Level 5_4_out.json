        "correct_solution": "The best way to do this is to find the probability that the two E's are next to each other.  There are $\\dfrac{7!}{2}$ arrangements of the word SIXTEEN.  If we want to find the number of arrangements such that the E's are next to each other, we find the number of arrangements of the six-letter word SIXT(EE)N (where we treat the two E's as a block), which is $6!$.  So the probability that an arrangement of the word SIXTEEN has the two E's next to each other is $\\dfrac{6!}{\\frac{7!}{2}} = \\dfrac{2}{7}$.  So the probability that the two E's aren't next to each other is $1 - \\dfrac{2}{7} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{7}}$.",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "## Step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of arrangements:**\n   - There are 7 letters in the word \"SIXTEEN\".\n   - The total number of ways to arrange 7 distinct letters is 7! (7 factorial) = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of arrangements where the two 'E's are together:**\n   - Treat the two 'E's as a single unit. Now we have 6 units to arrange (S, I, X, T, N, EE).\n   - These 6 units can be arranged in 6! = 720 ways.\n   - However, the two 'E's within the unit can also switch places, giving us 2! = 2 ways for each arrangement.\n   - Therefore, the total number of arrangements with the two 'E's together is 720 * 2 = 1440.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of arrangements where the two 'E's are not together:**\n   - Subtract the number of arrangements where the 'E's are together from the total number of arrangements: 5040 - 1440 = 3600.\n\n4. **Calculate the probability:**\n   - Divide the number of arrangements where the 'E's are not together by the total number of arrangements: 3600 / 5040 = 3/4.\n\n**Therefore, the probability that the two 'E's are not next to each other is  \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}.**"
