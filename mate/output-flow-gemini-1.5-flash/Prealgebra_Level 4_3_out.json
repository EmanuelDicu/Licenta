To find the equivalence between wallops and fallops, we need to find a common unit. We can do this by finding how many fallops are equivalent to one ballop:\n\n* 3 ballops = 11 fallops\n* 1 ballop = 11 fallops / 3 = 3.67 fallops (approximately)\n\nNow we can find how many fallops are equivalent to one wallop:\n\n* 6 wallops = 5 ballops\n* 1 wallop = 5 ballops / 6 = 0.83 ballops (approximately)\n* 1 wallop = 0.83 ballops * 3.67 fallops/ballops = 3.05 fallops (approximately)\n\n**Step 2: Calculate how many wallops are equivalent to 110 fallops.**\n\nWe know that 1 wallop is equivalent to approximately 3.05 fallops.  To find how many wallops are equivalent to 110 fallops, we can divide:\n\n* 110 fallops / 3.05 fallops/wallop = **36.07 wallops (approximately)**\n\n**Final Answer:**  \\boxed{36.07} wallops are equivalent to 110 fallops."
