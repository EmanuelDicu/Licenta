Substituting these values into the formula above, we get:\n\n45 = a / (1 - (-1/2))\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the equation**\n\nSimplifying the denominator, we have:\n\n45 = a / (3/2)\n\n**Step 4: Solve for the first term *a***\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by (3/2), we get:\n\na = 45 * (3/2) = 67.5\n\n**Step 5: State the answer**\n\nTherefore, the first term of the infinite geometric series is **\\boxed{67.5}**."
