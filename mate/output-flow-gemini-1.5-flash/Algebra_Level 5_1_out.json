            "gemini-1.5-flash": "## Step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Recognize the difference of squares pattern:** The expression $36 - 4x^2$ fits the pattern of the difference of squares: $a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)$.\n\n2. **Identify 'a' and 'b':** In our expression, $a^2 = 36$ and $b^2 = 4x^2$. Therefore, $a = 6$ and $b = 2x$.\n\n3. **Apply the difference of squares formula:** Substitute the values of 'a' and 'b' into the formula: $(a + b)(a - b) = (6 + 2x)(6 - 2x)$.\n\n4. **Simplify the result (optional):**  The expression $(6 + 2x)(6 - 2x)$ can be simplified by factoring out a 2 from both terms: $2(3 + x)2(3 - x) = 4(3 + x)(3 - x)$.\n\n## Final Answer:\n\nThe complete factorization of $36 - 4x^2$ is $\\boxed{4(3 + x)(3 - x)}$."
