        "correct_solution": "For there to be infinite solutions, the first equation needs to be consistent with the second and yet add no new information, which means it must be a multiple of the second. Since the coefficient of $y$ in the first equation is twice that of $y$ in the second equation, the multiplier is 2. This implies that the first equation must be $2(5x+y)=2(-3)$. After equating coefficients, this gives $2a=2\\cdot5$ and $b=2\\cdot-3$, or $(a,b)=\\boxed{(5,-6)}$.",

Let's try to make the second equation a multiple of the first.\n\nTo make the coefficients of $y$ match, we can multiply the second equation by 2: \n$$10x + 2y = -6.$$\n\nNow we want to find values for $a$ and $b$ that make the first equation a multiple of this new equation.  This means we need $2a = 10$ and $b=-6$. Solving for $a$, we get $a=5$.\n\nTherefore, the ordered pair $(a, b) = \\boxed{(5,-6)}$ satisfies the condition of having infinite solutions for the given system of equations."
