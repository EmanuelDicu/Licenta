            "gemini-1.5-flash": "## Solution:\n\n1. **Identify prime numbers less than 40:**  A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has only two divisors: 1 and itself. The prime numbers less than 40 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37.\n\n2. **Understand the goal:** We want to find the largest possible product of two *distinct* prime numbers from this list.\n\n3. **Maximize the product:** To maximize the product, we want to choose the two largest prime numbers from the list, which are 37 and 31.\n\n4. **Calculate the product:** 37 * 31 = 1147\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible product of any two distinct prime numbers less than 40 is **\\boxed{1147}**."
