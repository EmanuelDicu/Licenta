        "correct_solution": "We want to find the residue $c$ such that $35c \\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}$. Recall that, since 35 is relatively prime to 47, this inverse exists and is unique. To make use of the table we are given, we notice that $35 = 5\\cdot 7$. We can multiply both sides of $35c \\equiv 1\\pmod{47}$ by the inverse of 5 to obtain  \\begin{align*}\n19\\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot c &\\equiv 19\\cdot 1 \\pmod{47} \\implies \\\\\n(19\\cdot 5) \\cdot 7 \\cdot c &\\equiv 19 \\pmod{47} \\implies \\\\\n1 \\cdot 7 \\cdot c &\\equiv 19 \\pmod{47}. \\\\\n\\end{align*}Now we can multiply both sides by 27, the inverse of 7, to find  \\begin{align*}\n27\\cdot 7 \\cdot c &\\equiv 27\\cdot 19 \\pmod{47} \\implies \\\\\nc &\\equiv 513 \\pmod{47}.\n\\end{align*}Subtracting 470 from 513 does not change its residue (mod 47), so we have $c\\equiv 43\\pmod{47}$. Since $0\\leq 43 < 47$, $\\boxed{43}$ is the desired residue.\n\nRemark: More generally, the approach above shows that $(ab)^{-1}=b^{-1}a^{-1}$, where $b^{-1}$ denotes the modular inverse of $b$.",

Since we are working modulo 47, we can use the inverses of 5 and 7 from the table to find the inverse of 35.\n\n**Step 2: Use the properties of modular inverses**\n\nThe modular inverse of a product is the product of the modular inverses.  Therefore, the inverse of $35 \\pmod{47}$ is the product of the inverses of 5 and 7 modulo 47.  From the table, the inverse of 5 is 19 and the inverse of 7 is 27.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the product**\n\nThe product of the inverses is $19\\cdot27$.  Since we are working modulo 47, we can reduce this product modulo 47: \\begin{align*}\n19\\cdot27 &\\equiv (2\\cdot47-5)(2\\cdot47+3) \\\\\n&\\equiv -15 \\\\\n&\\equiv \\boxed{32} \\pmod{47}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the modular inverse of 35 modulo 47 is $\\boxed{32}$."
