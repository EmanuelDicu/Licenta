        "correct_solution": "Notice that for each integer $n$ satisfying $1 \\le n \\le 19, n \\neq 10$, then using the sum of cubes factorization, $n^3 + (20 - n)^3 = (n + 20 - n)(n^2 + (20-n)n + (20-n)^2)$ $ = 20(n^2 + (20-n)n + (20-n)^2)$. Thus, we can pair each integer with the difference between $20$ and that integer, and the sum of their cubes is divisible by $20$. Hence, the units digit of the sum of the first $19$ cubes, excluding $10$, is equal to $0$. Also, the units digits of $10^3$ and $20^3$ are clearly $0$, so we just need to find the units digit of the cube of $21$, which is $\\boxed{1}$.",

Let's examine the first few perfect cubes:\n\n* $1^3 = 1$\n* $2^3 = 8$\n* $3^3 = 27$\n* $4^3 = 64$\n* $5^3 = 125$\n* $6^3 = 216$\n* $7^3 = 343$\n* $8^3 = 512$\n* $9^3 = 729$ \n\nWe see a repeating pattern of units digits: 1, 8, 7, 4, 5, 6, 3, 2, 9.\n\n**Step 2: Utilize the pattern to find the units digit of the sum.**\n\nSince the units digit pattern repeats every nine cubes, we only need to consider the units digit of the first 21 perfect cubes, which is the same as the first 3 perfect cubes.\n\nThe sum of the units digits of the first 3 perfect cubes is 1 + 8 + 7 = 16.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the units digit of the sum.**\n\nThe units digit of 16 is **6**.\n\n**Final Answer:** The units digit of the sum of the first 21 positive perfect cubes is $\\boxed{6}$."
