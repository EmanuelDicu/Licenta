        "problem": "Liz has 11 marbles of different colors. In how many ways can she choose 3 of the marbles, if she refuses to choose the green one and the purple one at the same time?",
        "correct_solution": "We can divide this into cases:\n\nCase 1: Liz chooses the green marble, and not the purple marble. In this case, Liz must choose 2 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles (since she won't choose the purple marble). So, there are $\\binom{9}{2}=36$ choices in this case.\n\nCase 2: Liz chooses the purple marble, and not the green marble. As in Case 1, Liz must choose 2 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles. So, there are $\\binom{9}{2}$ choices in this case.\n\nCase 3: Liz chooses neither the green marble nor the purple marble. In this case, Liz must choose three marbles from the nine remaining marbles, and there are $\\binom{9}{3}=84$ choices in this case.\n\nThe total number of possible choices is $36+36+84=\\boxed{156}$.\n\nAlternatively, there are $\\binom{11}{3}=165$ ways to select three marbles. Of those, $\\binom{9}{1}=9$ ways contain both the purple marble and the green marble. Therefore, there are $165-9=\\boxed{156}$ ways to select three marbles such that purple and green marbles are not both chosen.",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "## Step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Calculate total possible combinations without any restriction:**\n   Liz has 11 marbles and needs to choose 3. The total number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula: \n   \u00b9\u00b9C\u2083 = 11! / (3! * 8!) = (11 * 10 * 9) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 165.\n\n2. **Calculate combinations where both green and purple marbles are chosen:**\n   If Liz chooses both green and purple, she only needs to choose one more marble from the remaining 9. This can be done in \u2079C\u2081 = 9 ways.\n\n3. **Subtract the unwanted combinations from the total:**\n   To find the number of ways Liz can choose 3 marbles without picking both green and purple together, we subtract the number of combinations where both are chosen from the total number of combinations:\n\n   165 - 9 = 156.\n\n**Therefore, Liz can choose 3 marbles in \\boxed{156} ways, given the constraint.**"
