        "correct_solution": "We know that the number of subsets of any given set is equal to $2^n,$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the set. First, then, we need to find the number of composite divisors. The prime factorization of $72$ is $72=2^3 \\cdot 3^2,$ so there are $(3+1)(2+1)=12$ total divisors. (To see this, note that we can form a divisor of the form $2^a 3^b$ by freely choosing $a=0,1,2,3$ and $b=0,1,2$). Of these, $1$ is neither prime nor composite, and $2$ and $3$ are prime, for a total of $9$ composite divisors. Therefore there are $2^9=\\boxed{512}$ subsets of the divisors of $72$ with only composite divisors.",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "## Step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Find the divisors of 72:** The divisors of 72 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.\n\n2. **Identify the composite divisors:**  A composite number is a natural number that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself.  So, the composite divisors of 72 are: 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.\n\n3. **Count the composite divisors:** There are 9 composite divisors of 72.\n\n4. **Count the subsets:**  Each composite divisor can either be in or out of a subset. Since we have 9 composite divisors, we have 2 choices for each: include it or exclude it. \n\n5. **Apply the Multiplication Principle:**  Therefore, there are $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^9$ possible subsets.\n\n6. **Don't forget the empty set:**  We need to include the empty set as a valid subset, which is one additional subset.\n\n7. **Final answer:** The total number of subsets of the divisors of 72 that contain only composite numbers, including the empty set, is $2^9 + 1 = \\boxed{513}$."
