Since $\\triangle AMB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle and $AB=6$, $AM=3\\sqrt{3}$. Since $AO$ is $2/3$ of $AM$, we have $AO=2\\sqrt{3}$. Thus, the area of the circle is $\\pi(2\\sqrt{3})^2=\\boxed{12\\pi}$.",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "## Solution:\n\n1. **Draw a diagram:** Draw an equilateral triangle ABC inscribed in a circle with center O. Draw the radius from the center O to a vertex of the triangle, say A.\n\n2. **Identify key relationships:**  The radius of the circle is also the altitude of the equilateral triangle.  Since the triangle is equilateral, this altitude bisects the base, creating a 30-60-90 right triangle.\n\n3. **Use the properties of 30-60-90 triangles:** In a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the longer leg is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of the shorter leg.  \n\n4. **Apply the properties to our triangle:**  The shorter leg of our 30-60-90 triangle is half the side of the equilateral triangle, which is 3 units. The hypotenuse, which is the radius of the circle, is twice the shorter leg, or 6 units.\n\n5. **Calculate the area of the circle:** The area of a circle is given by $\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius.  Since the radius is 6, the area of the circle is $\\pi (6)^2 = \\boxed{36\\pi}$ square units."
