To find the midpoint B, we plug in these values into the formula:\n\nMidpoint B = (8 + 48) / 2\nMidpoint B = 56 / 2\nMidpoint B = 28\n\nSo, the coordinate of B is 28.\n\n**Step 2: Find the midpoint of BQ (coordinate of C)**\n\nNow we know the coordinate of B (28) and Q (48). We can use the midpoint formula again to find the midpoint C:\n\nMidpoint C = (28 + 48) / 2\nMidpoint C = 76 / 2\nMidpoint C = 38\n\nSo, the coordinate of C is 38.\n\n**Step 3: Find the midpoint of PC (coordinate of D)**\n\nNow we know the coordinates of P (8) and C (38). We can use the midpoint formula again to find the midpoint D:\n\nMidpoint D = (8 + 38) / 2\nMidpoint D = 46 / 2\nMidpoint D = 23\n\nSo, the coordinate of D is 23.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe coordinate of point D is 23.\n\nBy breaking down the problem into smaller parts and using the midpoint formula repeatedly, we were able to find the coordinate of point D."
