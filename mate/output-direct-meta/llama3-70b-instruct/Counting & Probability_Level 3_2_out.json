        "problem": "There are 30 men and 40 women in the Town Library Club.  They wish to form a 7-person steering committee with 3 men and 4 women.  In how many ways can they form the committee?",
        "correct_solution": "In this problem, we're really selecting two separate committees.  We can choose 3 men from the 30 men total in $$ \\binom{30}{3} = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 4,\\!060 $$ways, and 4 women from the 40 women total in $$ \\binom{40}{4} = \\frac{40 \\times 39 \\times 38 \\times 37}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 91,\\!390 $$ways.  Since these two selections are independent (since for each of the $4,\\!060$ ways to pick the men, there are $91,\\!390$ ways to pick the women), we multiply them together to get the number of ways that we can form the 7-member overall committee: $$ \\binom{30}{3}\\binom{40}{4} = (4,\\!060)(91,\\!390) = \\boxed{371,\\!043,\\!400}. $$",

            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve it in a logical order.\n\n**Part 1: Selecting 3 men from 30 men**\n\nWe need to choose 3 men from a total of 30 men. This can be done in:\n\n30C3 = 30! / (3! \\* (30-3)!)\n= 30! / (3! \\* 27!)\n= (30 \\* 29 \\* 28) / (3 \\* 2 \\* 1)\n= 4060 ways\n\n**Part 2: Selecting 4 women from 40 women**\n\nWe need to choose 4 women from a total of 40 women. This can be done in:\n\n40C4 = 40! / (4! \\* (40-4)!)\n= 40! / (4! \\* 36!)\n= (40 \\* 39 \\* 38 \\* 37) / (4 \\* 3 \\* 2 \\* 1)\n= 91390 ways\n\n**Part 3: Combining the selections of men and women**\n\nSince the selections of men and women are independent, we multiply the number of ways to select 3 men and 4 women:\n\nTotal number of ways = 4060 \\* 91390\n= 370737400 ways\n\nTherefore, the steering committee can be formed in **370737400 ways**.\n\nNote: We used the combination formula (nCk) to find the number of ways to select k items from a set of n items, where order does not matter. The formula is:\n\nnCk = n! / (k! \\* (n-k)!)"
