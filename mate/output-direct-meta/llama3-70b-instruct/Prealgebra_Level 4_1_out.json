This means we have 9 digits to consider: d1, d2, ..., d9.\n\n**Part 2: Finding the possibilities for the first digit**\n\nSince the first digit cannot be zero, we have 9 possible options for d1: 1, 2, 3, ..., 9.\n\n**Part 3: Finding the possibilities for the remaining digits**\n\nFor each of the remaining 8 digits (d2, d3, ..., d9), we have 10 possible options: 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 9.\n\n**Part 4: Calculating the total number of possibilities**\n\nTo find the total number of possible 9-digit zip codes, we multiply the number of possibilities for each digit:\n\n* d1: 9 options (from Part 2)\n* d2: 10 options (from Part 3)\n* d3: 10 options (from Part 3)\n* ...\n* d9: 10 options (from Part 3)\n\nTo calculate the total number of possibilities, we multiply these options together:\n\n9 (options for d1) \u00d7 10 (options for d2) \u00d7 10 (options for d3) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 10 (options for d9)\n= 9 \u00d7 10^8\n= 9 \u00d7 100,000,000\n= 900,000,000\n\n**Solution**\n\nThere are 900,000,000 possible 9-digit zip codes if the first digit cannot be zero."
