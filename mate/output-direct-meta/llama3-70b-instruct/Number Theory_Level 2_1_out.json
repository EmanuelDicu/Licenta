        "correct_solution": "Note that for $n\\geq 2$, the last two digits of $5^n$ are 25.  To prove this, note that $5^2\\equiv 25 \\pmod{100}$, and whenever $5^{n-1}\\equiv 25\\pmod{100}$, we also have $5^n=5\\cdot 5^{n-1}\\equiv 5\\cdot 25 \\equiv 125 \\equiv 25 \\pmod{100}$. Thus the tens digit of $5^{2005}$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",

            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve it in a logical order.\n\n**Part 1: Understanding the problem**\nWe need to find the tens digit of $5^{2005}$. This means we need to find the digit in the tens place of the result when we raise 5 to the power of 2005.\n\n**Part 2: Pattern recognition**\nLet's look at the powers of 5:\n$$5^1 = 5$$\n$$5^2 = 25$$\n$$5^3 = 125$$\n$$5^4 = 625$$\n$$5^5 = 3125$$\nWe can see a pattern emerging. The units digit of $5^n$ is always 5, and the tens digit is cycling through the sequence 0, 2, 5, 2, 5, ... .\n\n**Part 3: Finding the cycle length**\nWe can see that the tens digit repeats every 4 powers of 5. This means that the cycle length is 4.\n\n**Part 4: Reducing the exponent modulo 4**\nSince the cycle length is 4, we can reduce the exponent 2005 modulo 4:\n$$2005 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$$\nThis means that we only need to consider $5^1$ to find the tens digit of $5^{2005}$.\n\n**Part 5: Finding the tens digit**\nFrom our observation in Part 2, we know that the tens digit of $5^1$ is 0.\n\n**Solution**\nThe tens digit of $5^{2005}$ is 0.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0."
