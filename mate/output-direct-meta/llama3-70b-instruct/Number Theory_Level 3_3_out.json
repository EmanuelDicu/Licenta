            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them logically.\n\n**Part 1: Understand the problem**\n\nThe problem asks us to find the smallest whole number $b$ such that 47 can be expressed in base $b$ using only two digits. This means we need to find the smallest base $b$ in which 47 can be represented using a two-digit number.\n\n**Part 2: Identify the key concept**\n\nThe key concept here is that in base $b$, the maximum value of a single digit is $b-1$. For example, in base 10, the maximum value of a single digit is 9 (10-1). In base 2, the maximum value of a single digit is 1 (2-1).\n\n**Part 3: Relate the concept to the problem**\n\nSince we want to express 47 in base $b$ using only two digits, the maximum value of the first digit (the tens digit) should be at least 47. Let's call the maximum value of a single digit in base $b$ as $m$. Then, we can write:\n\n$$m \\geq 47$$\n\n**Part 4: Convert the inequality to an equation**\n\nSince $m = b-1$, we can rewrite the inequality as:\n\n$$b-1 \\geq 47$$\n\n**Part 5: Solve for $b$**\n\nAdd 1 to both sides of the equation:\n\n$$b \\geq 48$$\n\nSince we want to find the smallest whole number $b$, we can take $b = 48$.\n\n**Part 6: Verify the solution**\n\nLet's verify that 47 can indeed be expressed in base 48 using only two digits. In base 48, we can write:\n\n$$47 = 1 \\times 48^1 + 1 \\times 48^0 = 11_{48}$$\n\nSo, 47 can be expressed as 11 in base 48, which uses only two digits.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe smallest whole number $b$ such that 47 can be expressed in base $b$ using only two digits is $\\boxed{48}$.\n\nNote that we could have also solved this problem by trial and error, starting from $b=10$ and incrementing $b$ until we find a base in which 47 can be expressed using only two digits. However, using the algebraic approach above allows us to systematically find the solution."
