        "correct_solution": "First, we need to multiply the units digit: $5_6 \\times 4_6 = 20_{10} = 32_6$. Hence, we write down a $2$ and carry-over the $3$. Evaluating the next digit, we need to multiply $1_6 \\times 4_6 + 3_6 = 7_{10} = 11_{6}$. Thus, the next digit is a $1$ and $1$ is carried over. Finally, the leftmost digits are given by $3_6 \\times 4_6 + 1_6 = 13_{10} = 21_6$. Writing this out:  $$\\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & & & \\stackrel{1}{3} & \\stackrel{3}{1} & \\stackrel{}{5}_6 \\\\\n& & & \\times & & & 4_6 \\\\\n\\cline{4-7} & & & 2 & 1 & 1 & 2_6 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{2112_6}$.",

To do this, we need to first understand what these numbers represent in base 6.\n\n**Step 2: Convert the numbers to base 10**\n\nTo make calculations easier, let's convert these numbers to base 10:\n\n$$315_6 = 3\\cdot 6^2 + 1\\cdot 6^1 + 5\\cdot 6^0 = 3\\cdot 36 + 1\\cdot 6 + 5\\cdot 1 = 108 + 6 + 5 = 119$$\n\n$$4_6 = 4\\cdot 6^0 = 4\\cdot 1 = 4$$\n\nSo, in base 10, the problem becomes: Find the product of $119 \\cdot 4$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the product**\n\nNow, let's calculate the product:\n\n$$119 \\cdot 4 = 476$$\n\n**Step 4: Convert the product back to base 6**\n\nTo express the answer in base 6, we need to convert 476 back to base 6:\n\n$$476 = 1144_6$$\n\n**The solution:**\n\nThe product of $315_6 \\cdot 4_6$ is $1144_6$.\n\nIn summary, we broke down the problem into smaller parts:\n\n1. Understood the problem and the numbers in base 6.\n2. Converted the numbers to base 10 to make calculations easier.\n3. Calculated the product in base 10.\n4. Converted the product back to base 6 to express the answer in the required format.\n\nThe final answer is $1144_6$, which is the product of $315_6 \\cdot 4_6$ in base 6."
