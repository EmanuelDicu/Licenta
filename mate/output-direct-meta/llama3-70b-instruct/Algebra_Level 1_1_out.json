        "correct_solution": "Because the question only asks for the value of $m$, we can begin by eliminating $n$. In order to do this, we multiply the second equation by 4, giving us a system of two equations where both coefficients of $n$ are 4: \\begin{align*} 3m+4n=47\n\\\\ 4m+4n=60\n\\end{align*}From here, we can just subtract the second equation from the first. This gives us $(3m+4n)-(4m+4n)=47-60$, which simplifies to $-m=-13$ or $m=\\boxed{13}$.",

We get:\n\n13 + n = 15\n\nSubtracting 13 from both sides gives:\n\nn = 2\n\nWe can then plug m = 13 and n = 2 into the other original equation, 3m + 4n = 47, to verify that it holds true:\n\n3(13) + 4(2) = 39 + 8 = 47\n\nYes, it does! Therefore, our solution m = 13 is correct."
