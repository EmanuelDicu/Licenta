            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve it in a logical order.\n\n**Step 1: Recognize the form of the expression**\nThe given expression is a difference of two squares: $36 - 4x^2$. This is a well-known algebraic form that can be factored easily.\n\n**Step 2: Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF)**\nThe GCF of 36 and 4 is 4. So, we can start by factoring out 4:\n\n$$36 - 4x^2 = 4(9 - x^2)$$\n\n**Step 3: Factor the difference of squares**\nNow, we have a difference of squares inside the parentheses: $9 - x^2$. This can be factored further using the formula:\n\n$$a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)$$\n\nIn this case, $a = 3$ and $b = x$. So, we get:\n\n$$9 - x^2 = (3 - x)(3 + x)$$\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results**\nNow, we can combine the results of Steps 2 and 3 to get the final factored form:\n\n$$36 - 4x^2 = 4(3 - x)(3 + x)$$\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is:\n\n$$36 - 4x^2 = \\boxed{4(3 - x)(3 + x)}$$\n\nThis is the completely factored form of the original expression."
