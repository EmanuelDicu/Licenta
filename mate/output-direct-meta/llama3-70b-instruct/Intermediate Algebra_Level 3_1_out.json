The sequence is formed by multiplying the corresponding terms of two arithmetic sequences.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the Arithmetic Sequences**\n\nLet's assume the two arithmetic sequences are:\n\nSequence 1: $a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, \\ldots$\nSequence 2: $b, b+e, b+2e, b+3e, \\ldots$\n\nWe are told that the terms of the given sequence are formed by multiplying the corresponding terms of these two sequences. Therefore, we can write the given sequence as:\n\n$1440 = ab$\n$1716 = (a+d)(b+e)$\n$1848 = (a+2d)(b+2e)$\n\nand so on.\n\n**Part 3: Finding the Common Differences**\n\nOur goal is to find the common differences $d$ and $e$. Let's try to find the differences between consecutive terms of the given sequence:\n\n$1716 - 1440 = 276$\n$1848 - 1716 = 132$\n\nWe can observe that the differences are decreasing by 144 (276 - 132 = 144). This suggests that the sequence of differences might be an arithmetic sequence itself.\n\n**Part 4: Finding the Common Differences of the Arithmetic Sequences**\n\nLet's assume the sequence of differences is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of -144. Then, we can write:\n\n$d+e = 276$\n$d+2e = 132$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\n\n$e = -144$\n\nSubstituting this back into either equation, we get:\n\n$d = 420$\n\nSo, the common differences of the two arithmetic sequences are $d = 420$ and $e = -144$.\n\n**Part 5: Finding the Initial Terms**\n\nNow that we have the common differences, let's find the initial terms $a$ and $b$. We can use the first two terms of the given sequence:\n\n$1440 = ab$\n$1716 = (a+420)(b-144)$\n\nSimplifying the second equation, we get:\n\n$1716 = ab - 144a + 420b - 60480$\n\nEquating this with the first equation, we get:\n\n$-144a + 420b - 60480 = 276$\n\nSimplifying and rearranging, we get:\n\n$420b - 144a = 60756$\n\nWe can use the first equation to express $b$ in terms of $a$:\n\n$b = \\frac{1440}{a}$\n\nSubstituting this into the above equation, we get:\n\n$420 \\cdot \\frac{1440}{a} - 144a = 60756$\n\nSimplifying and solving for $a$, we get:\n\n$a = 24$\n\nSubstituting this back into one of the earlier equations, we get:\n\n$b = 60$\n\nSo, the initial terms of the two arithmetic sequences are $a = 24$ and $b = 60$.\n\n**Part 6: Finding the Eighth Term**\n\nNow that we have the initial terms and common differences, we can find the eighth term of the sequence. The eighth term would be:\n\n$(a+7d)(b+7e) = (24+7(420))(60+7(-144)) = (24+2940)(60-1008) = 2964(-948) = \\boxed{-2810112}$\n\nTherefore, the eighth term of the sequence is -2810112."
