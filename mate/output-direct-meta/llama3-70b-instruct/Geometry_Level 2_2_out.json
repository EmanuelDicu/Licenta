        "correct_solution": "When an image is translated to the right we just add the number of units it is being translated to the original $x$-coordinate. When an image is translated down we just subtract that number of units from the $y$-coordinate. In this case we'll subtract 2 from the $y$-coordinates and add 3 to the   $x$-coordinates. This will make point $B(6, 5)$ move to $B'(6 + 3, 5 - 2) = \\boxed{(9, 3)}$.",

            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given a parallelogram with vertices A(2,5), B(6,5), C(5,2), and D(1,2). We need to translate the parallelogram down 2 units and right 3 units, and find the final coordinates of point B.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Translation**\n\nTranslation means moving an object from one position to another without changing its shape or size. In this case, we need to move the parallelogram down 2 units and right 3 units. This means we need to subtract 2 from the y-coordinate and add 3 to the x-coordinate of each point.\n\n**Step 3: Translate Point B**\n\nThe original coordinates of point B are (6,5). To translate it down 2 units, we subtract 2 from the y-coordinate: 5 - 2 = 3. To translate it right 3 units, we add 3 to the x-coordinate: 6 + 3 = 9.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Final Coordinates of Point B**\n\nAfter translating point B, its new coordinates are (9,3).\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nThe final coordinates of point B after translating the parallelogram down 2 units and right 3 units are (9,3)."
