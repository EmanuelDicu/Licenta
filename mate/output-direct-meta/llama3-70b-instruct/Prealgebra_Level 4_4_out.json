Let the radius of the smallest circle be r. Then, the area of the smallest circle is:\n\nArea of smallest circle = \u03c0 \u00d7 (radius)^2\n= \u03c0 \u00d7 r^2\n\nWe can set up an equation using the given information:\n\n25\u03c0 = \u03c0 \u00d7 r^2\n\n**Part 3: Simplify and solve the equation**\n\nWe can simplify the equation by canceling out \u03c0 on both sides:\n\n25 = r^2\n\nNow, we can take the square root of both sides to get:\n\nr = \u221a25\n= 5\n\nTherefore, the radius of the smallest circle is 5.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe radius of the smallest circle is 5."
