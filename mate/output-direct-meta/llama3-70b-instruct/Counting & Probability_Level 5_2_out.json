            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them logically.\n\n**Part 1: Counting the number of possible squares with side length 1**\n\nThe smallest square that can be formed on the 5x5 grid has a side length of 1. To form such a square, we need to choose two adjacent dots horizontally and two adjacent dots vertically. There are 4 ways to choose the horizontal pair (since there are 4 rows) and 4 ways to choose the vertical pair (since there are 4 columns). Therefore, the number of squares with side length 1 is:\n\n4 (horizontal choices) \u00d7 4 (vertical choices) = 16\n\n**Part 2: Counting the number of possible squares with side length 2**\n\nTo form a square with a side length of 2, we need to choose two dots that are 2 units apart horizontally and two dots that are 2 units apart vertically. There are 3 ways to choose the horizontal pair (since there are 3 possible starting points) and 3 ways to choose the vertical pair. Therefore, the number of squares with side length 2 is:\n\n3 (horizontal choices) \u00d7 3 (vertical choices) = 9\n\n**Part 3: Counting the number of possible squares with side length \u221a5**\n\nTo form a square with a side length of \u221a5, we need to choose two dots that are \u221a5 units apart diagonally. There are 2 ways to choose the diagonal pair (since there are 2 possible starting points). Therefore, the number of squares with side length \u221a5 is:\n\n2 (diagonal choices) = 2\n\n**Part 4: Counting the total number of squares**\n\nThe total number of squares is the sum of the number of squares with side lengths 1, 2, and \u221a5:\n\n16 (squares with side length 1) + 9 (squares with side length 2) + 2 (squares with side length \u221a5) = 27\n\nTherefore, there are **27** squares that have all four vertices on the 5x5 rectangular grid of dots.\n\nNote that we only considered squares with side lengths 1, 2, and \u221a5 because these are the only possible side lengths that can be formed on the 5x5 grid."
