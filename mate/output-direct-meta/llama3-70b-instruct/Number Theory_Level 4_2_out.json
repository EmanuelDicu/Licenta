        "correct_solution": "An integer is divisible by $18$ if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9$ and the last digit is even (meaning it is divisible by both 9 and 2).  The sum of the digits of $-11213141$ is 14.  Since $-11213141$ is negative, this number is 5 $\\textit{less than}$ a multiple of 9.  The number is 4 $\\textit{more than}$ a multiple of 9.  Subtracting 4 gives  \\[-11213141 = -11213145+4.\\]Since $-11213145$ has a digit sum of 18, this number is a multiple of 9.  However this is not a multiple of 18 so we need to subtract 9 again: \\[-11213141 = -11213154+13.\\]Now the number $-11213154$ is a multiple of 18, so the answer is $\\boxed{13}$. $$-11213141\\equiv 13\\pmod {18}.$$",

We can do this by taking the remainder of 11213141 when divided by 18.\n\nUsing the division algorithm, we get:\n\n$$11213141 = 6224180 \\times 18 + 1$$\n\nSo, the remainder is 1. Therefore, we can rewrite the congruence relation as:\n\n$$n+1\\equiv 0\\pmod{18}$$\n\n**Part 4: Solve for n**\n\nNow, we need to find an integer $n$ such that $n + 1$ is a multiple of 18. This is equivalent to finding an integer $n$ such that $n$ is 1 less than a multiple of 18.\n\nThe smallest multiple of 18 is 18, so we have:\n\n$$n + 1 = 18$$\n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides, we get:\n\n$$n = 17$$\n\nSince $0 \\le n < 18$, we can conclude that:\n\n$$n \\equiv 17\\pmod{18}$$\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe solution to the problem is $n = \\boxed{17}$."
