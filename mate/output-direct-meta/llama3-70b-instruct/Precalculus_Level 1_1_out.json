Since cosine is negative in the second and third quadrants, we know that \u03b8 lies in either the second or third quadrant.\n\n**Part 4: Find the reference angle**\nWe can find the reference angle by considering the unit circle. The cosine of an angle is the x-coordinate of the point on the unit circle corresponding to that angle. Since cos(\u03c0/3) = 1/2, we know that cos(-\u03c0/3) = -1/2, so the reference angle is \u03c0/3.\n\n**Part 5: Find the angle in the correct quadrant**\nSince \u03b8 lies in either the second or third quadrant, we need to find the angle in the correct quadrant that has a cosine of -1/2. We can do this by using the fact that the cosine is negative in the second and third quadrants.\n\nIn the second quadrant, \u03b8 = \u03c0 - \u03c0/3 = 2\u03c0/3.\n\nIn the third quadrant, \u03b8 = -\u03c0 + \u03c0/3 = -2\u03c0/3.\n\nSince arccos is defined to return an angle in [0, \u03c0], we choose \u03b8 = 2\u03c0/3 as the correct answer.\n\n**Conclusion**\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is arccos(-1/2) = 2\u03c0/3 radians.\n\nI hope this step-by-step solution helps!"
