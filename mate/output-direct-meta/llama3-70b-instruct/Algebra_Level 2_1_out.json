Let's use elimination. We can eliminate the variable y by multiplying equation (1) by 1 and equation (2) by 2, and then adding the two equations.\n\n Multiply equation (1) by 1:\n5x - 2y = 7\n\nMultiply equation (2) by 2:\n6x + 2y = 4\n\nAdd the two equations to eliminate y:\n(5x - 2y) + (6x + 2y) = 7 + 4\n5x + 6x = 11\n11x = 11\n\nNow, divide by 11 to solve for x:\nx = 11/11\nx = 1\n\n**Part 3: Find the value of y**\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of y. Let's use equation (2):\n3x + y = 2\n3(1) + y = 2\n3 + y = 2\ny = -1\n\n**Part 4: Compute 24x - 14y**\nNow that we have the values of x and y, we can compute the value of 24x - 14y:\n24x - 14y = 24(1) - 14(-1)\n= 24 + 14\n= 38\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is **38**. The value of 24x - 14y is 38."
