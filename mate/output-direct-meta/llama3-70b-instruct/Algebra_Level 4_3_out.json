        "correct_solution": "The constant term of the product of two polynomials is just the product of the two constant terms. Therefore we know that $6=-2a$, so $a=-3$. We now consider the linear term of the product of our polynomials. It's given by $-16t=(5t\\cdot-2)+a\\cdot bt\\Longrightarrow-16t=-10t+(-3)bt\\Longrightarrow b=2$. Therefore our answer is $a+b=\\boxed{-1}$.",

To find the product, we need to multiply the two expressions.\n\n$$(3t^2+5t+a)(4t^2+bt-2)$$\n\nTo multiply, we'll use the distributive property:\n\n$$3t^2(4t^2+bt-2) + 5t(4t^2+bt-2) + a(4t^2+bt-2)$$\n\nNow, let's multiply each term:\n\n$$12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a$$\n\n**Part 2: Combining like terms**\n\nLet's combine like terms:\n\n$$12t^4 + (3b+20)t^3 + (5b+4a-6)t^2 + (ab-10)t - 2a$$\n\n**Part 3: Equating coefficients**\n\nWe are given that the product is equal to $12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6$.
