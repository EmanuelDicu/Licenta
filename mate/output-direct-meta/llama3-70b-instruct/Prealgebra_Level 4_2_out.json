        "correct_solution": "Instead of adding up scores and figuring out the new averages, a quicker way (useful for the countdown round) is as follows:\n\nSince the average is 90, we first calculate how many points below 90 he already is: he's scored 87, 85, and 87, meaning that he is 3, 5, and 3 points below 90 respectively, making for a total of 11 points below.  We then know that his remaining two tests must be a combined 11 points above 90, and since they differ by 3 points, we know that one test is 4 above 90, and the other is 7 above 90, meaning his highest score was $\\boxed{97}$.",

            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them step by step.\n\n**Part 1: Calculate the total score needed for a 90% average**\n\nEd wants to have a 90% average on his 5 tests, each worth 100 points. To find the total score needed, we can multiply the number of tests by the desired average score:\n\nTotal score needed = 5 tests x 90% of 100 points = 5 x 0.9 x 100 = 450 points\n\n**Part 2: Calculate the total score Ed has so far**\n\nEd has taken 3 tests and scored 87, 85, and 87 points. Let's add up his scores so far:\n\nTotal score so far = 87 + 85 + 87 = 259 points\n\n**Part 3: Calculate the remaining score needed**\n\nEd needs a total score of 450 points, but he has already scored 259 points. Let's find out how many points he still needs:\n\nRemaining score needed = 450 - 259 = 191 points\n\n**Part 4: Analyze the last two tests**\n\nThe problem states that the scores of Ed's last two tests differ by three points. Let's call the score of the fourth test x. Then, the score of the fifth test is x + 3.\n\n**Part 5: Set up an equation and solve for x**\n\nEd needs a total score of 191 points on his last two tests. We can set up an equation using the variables x and x + 3:\n\nx + (x + 3) = 191\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x + 3 = 191\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n2x = 188\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 94\n\n**Part 6: Find the highest test score**\n\nSince x is the score of the fourth test, the score of the fifth test is x + 3 = 94 + 3 = 97. Therefore, Ed's highest test score is 97 points.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nEd's highest test score is 97 points."
