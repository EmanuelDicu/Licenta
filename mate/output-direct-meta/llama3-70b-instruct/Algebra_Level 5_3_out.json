        "problem": "Billy shoots an arrow from 10 feet above the ground. The height of this arrow can be expressed by the equation $h=10-23t-10t^2$, where $t$ is time in seconds since the arrow was shot. If the center of a target is raised 5 feet off the ground, in how many seconds must the arrow reach the target in order for Billy to hit the bulls eye?",
        "correct_solution": "Since the center of the target is 5 feet above the ground, $h=5$. So we get the quadratic: \\begin{align*}5& =10-23t-10t^{2}\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 0& =10t^{2}+23t-5\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 0&=(2t+5)(5t-1).\n\\end{align*}Thus, the values of $t$ that satisfy the equation are $-\\frac52$ and $\\frac15$. However, since time can never be a negative number, the answer must be $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{5}}$.",

            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them step by step.\n\n**Part 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe are given an equation that describes the height of the arrow above the ground as a function of time:\n\nh = 10 - 23t - 10t^2\n\nWe are asked to find the time it takes for the arrow to reach a target that is 5 feet off the ground.\n\n**Part 2: Setting up the Equation**\n\nWe need to set up an equation that represents the situation when the arrow hits the target. Since the target is 5 feet off the ground, we can set the height (h) equal to 5:\n\n5 = 10 - 23t - 10t^2\n\n**Part 3: Simplifying the Equation**\n\nWe can simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n\n5 = 10 - 23t - 10t^2\n-5 = -23t - 10t^2\n0 = -23t - 10t^2 + 5\n\n**Part 4: Factoring the Quadratic**\n\nThe equation is a quadratic in terms of t. We can try to factor it:\n\n0 = -10t^2 - 23t + 5\n\nUnfortunately, this quadratic does not factor nicely. We can try to use the quadratic formula instead.\n\n**Part 5: Using the Quadratic Formula**\n\nThe quadratic formula is given by:\n\nt = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our case, a = -10, b = -23, and c = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nt = (23 \u00b1 \u221a((-23)^2 - 4(-10)(5))) / (2(-10))\nt = (23 \u00b1 \u221a(529 + 200)) / (-20)\nt = (23 \u00b1 \u221a729) / (-20)\nt = (23 \u00b1 27) / (-20)\n\n**Part 6: Solving for t**\n\nWe have two possible solutions for t:\n\nt = (23 + 27) / (-20) = 50 / (-20) = -2.5 seconds ( rejected, since time cannot be negative)\nt = (23 - 27) / (-20) = -4 / (-20) = 0.2 seconds\n\n**Part 7: Conclusion**\n\nThe arrow will hit the target approximately 0.2 seconds after it was shot.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is t = 0.2 seconds."
