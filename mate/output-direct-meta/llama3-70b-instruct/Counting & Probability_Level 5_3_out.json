        "correct_solution": "We know that the number of subsets of any given set is equal to $2^n,$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the set. First, then, we need to find the number of composite divisors. The prime factorization of $72$ is $72=2^3 \\cdot 3^2,$ so there are $(3+1)(2+1)=12$ total divisors. (To see this, note that we can form a divisor of the form $2^a 3^b$ by freely choosing $a=0,1,2,3$ and $b=0,1,2$). Of these, $1$ is neither prime nor composite, and $2$ and $3$ are prime, for a total of $9$ composite divisors. Therefore there are $2^9=\\boxed{512}$ subsets of the divisors of $72$ with only composite divisors.",

            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them logically.\n\n**Part 1: Find the divisors of 72**\n\nThe divisors of 72 are:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\n\n**Part 2: Identify the composite divisors**\n\nA composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself. In the list of divisors above, the composite divisors are:\n\n4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36\n\n**Part 3: Find the total number of subsets of composite divisors**\n\nLet's denote the set of composite divisors as C. We want to find the number of subsets of C.\n\nThe total number of subsets of C is 2^|C|, where |C| is the cardinality (number of elements) of C.\n\n|C| = 8 (since there are 8 composite divisors)\n\nSo, the total number of subsets of C is:\n\n2^8 = 256\n\n**Part 4: Exclude the subsets that contain at least one non-composite divisor**\n\nHowever, we only want to count the subsets that contain only composite numbers. This means we need to exclude the subsets that contain at least one non-composite divisor (i.e., 1, 2, or 3).\n\nLet's count the number of subsets that contain at least one non-composite divisor:\n\n* Subsets containing 1: 2^7 (since we're choosing from the remaining 7 composite divisors)\n* Subsets containing 2: 2^7 (since we're choosing from the remaining 7 composite divisors)\n* Subsets containing 3: 2^7 (since we're choosing from the remaining 7 composite divisors)\n* Subsets containing 1 and 2: 2^6 (since we're choosing from the remaining 6 composite divisors)\n* Subsets containing 1 and 3: 2^6 (since we're choosing from the remaining 6 composite divisors)\n* Subsets containing 2 and 3: 2^6 (since we're choosing from the remaining 6 composite divisors)\n* Subsets containing 1, 2, and 3: 2^5 (since we're choosing from the remaining 5 composite divisors)\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle, we can calculate the total number of subsets that contain at least one non-composite divisor as:\n\n2^7 + 2^7 + 2^7 - 2^6 - 2^6 - 2^6 + 2^5 = 128 + 128 + 128 - 64 - 64 - 64 + 32 = 224\n\n**Part 5: Find the number of subsets containing only composite numbers**\n\nNow, we can subtract the number of subsets that contain at least one non-composite divisor from the total number of subsets of C:\n\n256 - 224 = 32\n\nSo, there are 32 subsets of the set of divisors of 72 that contain only composite numbers, including the empty set.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe solution to the problem is 32."
