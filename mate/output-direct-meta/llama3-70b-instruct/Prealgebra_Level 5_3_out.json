        "problem": "In Mathopolis, an adult is a person 21 years of age or older and a child is a person under 21 years of age.  Exactly half of the  adults in Mathopolis are female, and exactly half of the female  adults have exactly one biological child.  Nobody else has a  child, and there are no other children.  What percent of the  people of Mathopolis are children?",
        "correct_solution": "Let the percentage of people in Mathopolis who are children be $x$. The percentage of adults is then $1-x$. Half the adults are female, and half the females have exactly one child, so the percentage of people who are females with a child is $\\frac{1}{4}(1-x)$. This percentage is equal to the percentage of children, since there is a correspondence between a mother and a child. So we have the equation $x=\\frac{1}{4}(1-x)$. Solving for $x$ yields $x=1/5$, or $\\boxed{20}$ percent.",

This means that the other half of the adults are male.\n\nSo, we have two subcategories of adults:\n\n* Female adults\n* Male adults\n\n**Part 3: Identify the subcategory of female adults with children**\n\nWe are told that exactly half of the female adults have exactly one biological child. This means that the other half of the female adults do not have any children.\n\nSo, we have two subcategories of female adults:\n\n* Female adults with one child\n* Female adults without children\n\n**Part 4: Determine the total number of children**\n\nSince only female adults with one child have children, and there are no other children, the total number of children is equal to the number of female adults with one child.\n\n**Part 5: Set up an equation to represent the situation**\n\nLet's say the total population of Mathopolis is 100%. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:\n\n Adults (50% female + 50% male) + Children = 100%\n\nWe know that exactly half of the female adults have one child, so the number of children is equal to half of the number of female adults.\n\nLet F be the number of female adults. Then, the number of children is F/2.\n\n**Part 6: Solve for the percentage of children**\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent the situation:\n\nF/2 = x%\n\nwhere x is the percentage of children in Mathopolis.\n\nSince half of the adults are female, the number of female adults (F) is equal to half of the total number of adults.\n\nLet A be the total number of adults. Then, F = A/2.\n\nSubstituting this into the equation above, we get:\n\n(A/2)/2 = x%\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nA/4 = x%\n\n**Part 7: Find the percentage of adults**\n\nWe know that the total population of Mathopolis is 100%. The percentage of adults is therefore 100% - x%.\n\nSince A/4 = x%, we can set up an equation to find the percentage of adults:\n\n100% - A/4 = percentage of adults\n\n**Part 8: Find the solution**\n\nWe can solve for A by setting up an equation based on the fact that the total population is 100%:\n\nA + A/4 = 100%\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n5A/4 = 100%\n\nA = 80%\n\nSo, the percentage of adults is 80%, and the percentage of children is:\n\n100% - 80% = 20%\n\nTherefore, **20% of the people in Mathopolis are children**.\n\nI hope this step-by-step solution helps! Let me know if you have any questions."
