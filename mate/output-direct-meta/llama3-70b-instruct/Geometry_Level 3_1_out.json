            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "I'd be happy to help you solve this Level 3 geometry problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\n\nThe problem states that a sphere is inscribed in a cube, which means the sphere is completely contained within the cube and touches all six faces of the cube. We are also given that the volume of the sphere is $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$ cubic inches. Our goal is to find the volume of the cube.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the radius of the sphere to the side length of the cube**\n\nWhen a sphere is inscribed in a cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube. This is because the sphere touches all six faces of the cube, so the diameter of the sphere must be equal to the distance between two opposite faces of the cube, which is the side length of the cube.\n\nLet's call the radius of the sphere \"r\" and the side length of the cube \"s\". Since the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube, we can write:\n\n2r = s\n\n**Step 3: Express the volume of the sphere in terms of the radius**\n\nThe formula for the volume of a sphere is:\n\nV = (4/3)\u03c0r^3\n\nWe are given that the volume of the sphere is $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$ cubic inches, so we can set up the equation:\n\n(4/3)\u03c0r^3 = \u03c0/6\n\n**Step 4: Solve for the radius of the sphere**\n\nTo solve for r, we can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n4\u03c0r^3 = \u03c0/2\n\nNext, we can divide both sides by 4\u03c0 to isolate r^3:\n\nr^3 = 1/8\n\nTaking the cube root of both sides, we get:\n\nr = 1/2\n\n**Step 5: Express the side length of the cube in terms of the radius**\n\nFrom Step 2, we know that 2r = s. Now that we have found r, we can find s:\n\n2(1/2) = s\n\ns = 1\n\n**Step 6: Find the volume of the cube**\n\nThe formula for the volume of a cube is:\n\nV = s^3\n\nSince we found that s = 1, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nV = 1^3\nV = 1\n\nSo, the volume of the cube is 1 cubic inch.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe solution to the problem is that the volume of the cube is 1 cubic inch."
