        "correct_solution": "Let the number of dimes Hillary has be $d$ and the number of nickels she has be $n$. We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\nd+n&=11\\\\\n10d+5n&=75\n\\end{align*} (The last equation is in terms of cents.) To make the second equation nicer, we divide both sides by 5 to get $2d+n=15$. From the first given equation, we have $d=11-n$. Substituting this into the simplified second given equation to eliminate $d$, we get $2(11-n)+n=15\\Rightarrow n=7$. Thus, Hillary has $\\boxed{7}$ nickels.",

The total value of these coins is 75 cents. We need to find the number of nickels she has.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the values of each coin**\n\nA dime is worth 10 cents, and a nickel is worth 5 cents. We'll use these values to help us solve the problem.\n\n**Step 3: Let's use variables**\n\nLet's say the number of dimes Hillary has is x. Since she has 11 coins in total, the number of nickels she has is 11 - x.\n\n**Step 4: Set up an equation**\n\nWe know that the total value of the coins is 75 cents. We can set up an equation to represent this:\n\n10x + 5(11 - x) = 75\n\nHere, 10x represents the total value of the dimes (10 cents each), and 5(11 - x) represents the total value of the nickels (5 cents each).\n\n**Step 5: Simplify the equation**\n\nLet's simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n\n10x + 55 - 5x = 75\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n5x + 55 = 75\n\nSubtract 55 from both sides:\n\n5x = 20\n\n**Step 6: Solve for x**\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\nx = 20/5\nx = 4\n\n**Step 7: Find the number of nickels**\n\nWe found that x = 4, which means Hillary has 4 dimes. Since she has 11 coins in total, the number of nickels she has is:\n\n11 - x = 11 - 4\n= 7\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nHillary has 7 nickels.\n\nThe solution to the problem is 7."
