        "problem": "Sarah, James, and Matthew are on a team in a game show. In the game, Sarah always earns 5 points, Matthew always earns -2 points, and James always earns 3 points. To calculate their team's score, they multiply the first person's score by the second person's score, then subtract the third person's score. If they can choose the order in which they play the game, what is the maximum possible score that their team can earn?",
        "correct_solution": "If we let the first, second, and third persons' score equal $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively, then their team's score is $((a \\cdot b)-c)$.  We may test all six possible orderings:\n$a = 5$, $b = -2$, $c = 3 \\rightarrow ((5 \\cdot (-2)) - 3) = -13$\n$a = -2$, $b = 5$, $c = 3 \\rightarrow (((-2) \\cdot 5) - 3) = -13$\n$a = 5$, $b = 3$, $c = -2 \\rightarrow ((5 \\cdot 3) - (-2)) = 17$\n$a = 3$, $b = 5$, $c = -2 \\rightarrow ((3 \\cdot 5) - (-2)) = 17$\n$a = 3$, $b = -2$, $c = 5 \\rightarrow ((3 \\cdot (-2)) - 5) = -11$\n$a = -2$, $b = 3$, $c = 5 \\rightarrow (((-2) \\cdot 3) - 5) = -11$\nThus, our total answer is $\\boxed{17}$\nAdditionally, we may note that the only way to obtain a positive answer is to multiply the two positive scores together and subtract the negative score.  Because multiplication is commutative, the order of $a$ and $b$ does not matter, and we need only compute the single case $(3 \\cdot 5) - (-2) = \\boxed{17}$",

            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve it in a logical order.\n\n**Part 1: Understand the scoring system**\n\nWe are given the individual scores of each team member:\n\n* Sarah always earns 5 points\n* Matthew always earns -2 points\n* James always earns 3 points\n\nWe need to understand how the team's score is calculated:\n\n* Multiply the first person's score by the second person's score\n* Subtract the third person's score from the product\n\n**Part 2: Identify the possible orderings**\n\nSince there are three team members, there are 3! = 6 possible orderings:\n\n1. Sarah-James-Matthew\n2. Sarah-Matthew-James\n3. James-Sarah-Matthew\n4. James-Matthew-Sarah\n5. Matthew-Sarah-James\n6. Matthew-James-Sarah\n\n**Part 3: Calculate the team's score for each ordering**\n\nLet's calculate the team's score for each of the 6 possible orderings:\n\n1. Sarah-James-Matthew:\nScore = (5 \u00d7 3) - (-2) = 15 + 2 = 17\n2. Sarah-Matthew-James:\nScore = (5 \u00d7 -2) - 3 = -10 - 3 = -13\n3. James-Sarah-Matthew:\nScore = (3 \u00d7 5) - (-2) = 15 + 2 = 17\n4. James-Matthew-Sarah:\nScore = (3 \u00d7 -2) - 5 = -6 - 5 = -11\n5. Matthew-Sarah-James:\nScore = (-2 \u00d7 5) - 3 = -10 - 3 = -13\n6. Matthew-James-Sarah:\nScore = (-2 \u00d7 3) - 5 = -6 - 5 = -11\n\n**Part 4: Find the maximum possible score**\n\nAfter calculating the team's score for each ordering, we can see that the maximum possible score is 17, which occurs in two orderings: Sarah-James-Matthew and James-Sarah-Matthew.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe maximum possible score that their team can earn is 17. They can achieve this score by playing in either the order of Sarah-James-Matthew or James-Sarah-Matthew."
