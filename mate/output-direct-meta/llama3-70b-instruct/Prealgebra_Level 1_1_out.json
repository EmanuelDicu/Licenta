Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\nThe problem asks us to compute the product of two exponential expressions: `(2^3)` and `(5^5)`. Our goal is to evaluate this product mentally.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the exponentials separately**\nLet's evaluate each exponential expression separately:\n\n* `(2^3)`: This means \"2 to the power of 3\". In other words, we need to multiply 2 by itself 3 times: `2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 8`\n* `(5^5)`: This means \"5 to the power of 5\". In other words, we need to multiply 5 by itself 5 times: `5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 = 3125`\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the results**\nNow that we have evaluated each exponential expression, we can multiply the results:\n\n`8 \u00d7 3125 = ?`\n\nTo multiply 8 by 3125, I'll break it down further:\n\n`8 \u00d7 3000 = 24,000` (easy multiplication)\n`8 \u00d7 200 = 1600` (another easy multiplication)\n`8 \u00d7 25 = 200` (yet another easy multiplication)\n\nAdd up the partial products:\n`24,000 + 1600 + 200 = 25,800`\n\n**Solution**\nThe product of `(2^3)` and `(5^5)` is `25,800`.\n\nBy breaking down the problem into smaller parts and using mental math tricks, we were able to compute the product in our heads!"
