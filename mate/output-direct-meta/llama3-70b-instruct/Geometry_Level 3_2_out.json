Since $K$ is a point on segment $\\overline{BC}$, we can find the length of the base $BC$ by adding the lengths of $BK$ and $CK$:\n\n$$BC = BK + CK = 8 + 6 = 14$$\n\n**Part 2: Find the height of the triangle (AK)**\n\nWe are given that $AK = 6$, which is the height of the triangle.\n\n**Part 3: Find the length of AB and AC using the Pythagorean theorem**\n\nSince $AK$ is an altitude to $\\triangle ABC$, we can form two right triangles: $\\triangle ABK$ and $\\triangle ACK$. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of $AB$ and $AC$.\n\nFor $\\triangle ABK$:\n\n$$AB^2 = AK^2 + BK^2$$\n$$AB^2 = 6^2 + 8^2$$\n$$AB^2 = 36 + 64$$\n$$AB = \\sqrt{100} = 10$$\n\nFor $\\triangle ACK$:\n\n$$AC^2 = AK^2 + CK^2$$\n$$AC^2 = 6^2 + 6^2$$\n$$AC^2 = 36 + 36$$\n$$AC = \\sqrt{72} = 6\\sqrt{2}$$\n\n**Part 4: Find the perimeter of the triangle**\n\nNow that we have the lengths of all three sides, we can find the perimeter of the triangle:\n\n$$Perimeter = AB + BC + AC$$\n$$Perimeter = 10 + 14 + 6\\sqrt{2}$$\n\n**Simplifying the perimeter**\n\nWe can simplify the perimeter by combining the integer terms and leaving the radical term separate:\n\n$$Perimeter = 24 + 6\\sqrt{2}$$\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is that the perimeter of the triangle is $24 + 6\\sqrt{2}$."
