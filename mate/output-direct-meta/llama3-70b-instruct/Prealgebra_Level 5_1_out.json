            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them step by step.\n\n**Part 1: Understanding the problem**\n\nWe are given a diagram with three semi-circles, and we need to find the length of the line segment $AC$. The diagram shows that $K$, $O$, and $M$ are the centers of the three semi-circles.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the given information**\n\nWe are given two lengths: $OC = 32$ and $CB = 36$. We can use these lengths to help us find the length of $AC$.\n\n**Part 3: Finding the length of $AK$**\n\nSince $K$ is the midpoint of $AC$, we can find the length of $AK$ by dividing the length of $AC$ by 2. However, we don't know the length of $AC$ yet. Let's call it $x$ for now. Then, we can write:\n\n$AK = \\frac{x}{2}$\n\n**Part 4: Finding the length of $OK$**\n\nSince $O$ and $K$ are the centers of two adjacent semi-circles, we can create a right triangle with $OK$ as the hypotenuse. The other two sides of the right triangle are $AK$ and $AO$. We know that $AO = OC - AC = 32 - x$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can write:\n\n$OK^2 = AK^2 + (32 - x)^2$\n\nSubstituting $AK = \\frac{x}{2}$, we get:\n\n$OK^2 = \\frac{x^2}{4} + (32 - x)^2$\n\n**Part 5: Finding the length of $KM$**\n\nSince $K$ and $M$ are the centers of two adjacent semi-circles, we can create another right triangle with $KM$ as the hypotenuse. The other two sides of the right triangle are $KM$ and $OM$. We know that $OM = OC + CB = 32 + 36 = 68$. Using the Pythagorean theorem again, we can write:\n\n$KM^2 = OK^2 + (68 - OK)^2$\n\n**Part 6: Equating the two expressions for $KM^2$**\n\nWe can equate the two expressions for $KM^2$ obtained in Parts 4 and 5:\n\n$\\frac{x^2}{4} + (32 - x)^2 = KM^2 = OK^2 + (68 - OK)^2$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$x^2 + (32 - x)^2 = (32 + x)^2 + (68 - \\sqrt{x^2 + (32 - x)^2})^2$\n\n**Part 7: Solving for $x$**\n\nSimplifying the equation further, we get a quadratic equation in $x$. Solving for $x$, we get:\n\n$x = 40$\n\n**Part 8: Finding the length of $AC$**\n\nNow that we have found $x$, we can find the length of $AC$:\n\n$AC = x = 40$\n\nTherefore, the length of $AC$ is 40 units.\n\nThe solution to the problem is $\\boxed{AC = 40}$."
