        "correct_solution": "For a circle of radius $r$ and an arc of $\\theta$ degrees, the arc length is $(2\\pi r)\\frac{\\theta}{360}$. Thus, for the same arc length, the arc angle is inversely proportional to the radius, so the ratio of the radius of circle $A$ to the radius of circle $B$ is $40:55$, or $8:11$. Since the ratio of the areas of two circles is the square of the ratio of their radii, the ratio of the area of circle $A$ to the area of circle $B$ is $(8/11)^2=\\boxed{\\frac{64}{121}}$.",

            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them step by step.\n\n**Part 1: Understand the given information**\n\nWe are given that an arc of 55 degrees on circle A has the same length as an arc of 40 degrees on circle B. This means that the corresponding central angles of the arcs are 55 degrees and 40 degrees, respectively.\n\n**Part 2: Relate the arc lengths to the radii**\n\nLet's denote the radius of circle A as r_A and the radius of circle B as r_B. We can use the formula for the length of an arc:\n\nArc length = (Central angle/360) \u00d7 2\u03c0 \u00d7 Radius\n\nLet's denote the length of the arc on circle A as L_A and the length of the arc on circle B as L_B. Since L_A = L_B, we can set up the equation:\n\n(55/360) \u00d7 2\u03c0 \u00d7 r_A = (40/360) \u00d7 2\u03c0 \u00d7 r_B\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nr_A / r_B = 40/55\n\n**Part 3: Relate the radii to the areas**\n\nNow, we want to find the ratio of the areas of the two circles. The area of a circle is given by:\n\nArea = \u03c0 \u00d7 Radius^2\n\nLet's denote the area of circle A as A_A and the area of circle B as A_B. We can write:\n\nA_A = \u03c0 \u00d7 r_A^2\nA_B = \u03c0 \u00d7 r_B^2\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the areas:\n\nA_A / A_B = (\u03c0 \u00d7 r_A^2) / (\u03c0 \u00d7 r_B^2)\n\nCanceling out the \u03c0 terms, we get:\n\nA_A / A_B = (r_A^2) / (r_B^2)\n\n**Part 4: Express the ratio of the areas in terms of the radii ratio**\n\nRecall the equation from Part 2:\n\nr_A / r_B = 40/55\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation, we get:\n\nr_A^2 / r_B^2 = (40/55)^2\n\nSubstituting this into the equation from Part 3, we get:\n\nA_A / A_B = (40/55)^2\n\n**Part 5: Simplify the ratio of the areas**\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nA_A / A_B = (16/121)\n\nExpressing the answer as a common fraction, we get:\n\nA_A / A_B = 16/121\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the area of circle A to the area of circle B is 16/121."
