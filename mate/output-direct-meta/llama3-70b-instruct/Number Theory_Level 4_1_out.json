        "correct_solution": "We want to find the residue $c$ such that $35c \\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}$. Recall that, since 35 is relatively prime to 47, this inverse exists and is unique. To make use of the table we are given, we notice that $35 = 5\\cdot 7$. We can multiply both sides of $35c \\equiv 1\\pmod{47}$ by the inverse of 5 to obtain  \\begin{align*}\n19\\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot c &\\equiv 19\\cdot 1 \\pmod{47} \\implies \\\\\n(19\\cdot 5) \\cdot 7 \\cdot c &\\equiv 19 \\pmod{47} \\implies \\\\\n1 \\cdot 7 \\cdot c &\\equiv 19 \\pmod{47}. \\\\\n\\end{align*}Now we can multiply both sides by 27, the inverse of 7, to find  \\begin{align*}\n27\\cdot 7 \\cdot c &\\equiv 27\\cdot 19 \\pmod{47} \\implies \\\\\nc &\\equiv 513 \\pmod{47}.\n\\end{align*}Subtracting 470 from 513 does not change its residue (mod 47), so we have $c\\equiv 43\\pmod{47}$. Since $0\\leq 43 < 47$, $\\boxed{43}$ is the desired residue.\n\nRemark: More generally, the approach above shows that $(ab)^{-1}=b^{-1}a^{-1}$, where $b^{-1}$ denotes the modular inverse of $b$.",

            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them step by step.\n\n**Part 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to find the modular inverse of 35 modulo 47. This means we need to find a residue $c$ such that $35c \\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}$. In other words, we need to find a number $c$ between 0 and 46 (inclusive) such that when we multiply 35 by $c$, the result is congruent to 1 modulo 47.\n\n**Part 2: Observing the Pattern in the Table**\n\nThe given table shows the inverses of the first 9 positive residues modulo 47. We can observe that the inverses are not random numbers, but rather, they seem to have some relationship with the residues themselves.\n\n**Part 3: Identifying the Pattern**\n\nUpon closer inspection, we notice that the inverse of a residue $b$ is obtained by finding the residue that, when multiplied by $b$, gives 1 modulo 47. For example, the inverse of 2 is 24 because $2 \\cdot 24 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}$.\n\n**Part 4: Applying the Pattern to Find the Inverse of 35**\n\nTo find the inverse of 35, we can try to find a number $c$ such that $35c \\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}$. Since 35 is not present in the table, we need to find a way to relate it to one of the residues in the table.\n\nNotice that $35 \\equiv -12 \\pmod{47}$, since $35 = -12 + 47$. This means we can find the inverse of 35 by finding the inverse of -12, which is equivalent to finding the inverse of 12.\n\n**Part 5: Using the Table to Find the Inverse**\n\nFrom the table, we know that the inverse of 4 is 12. This means that $4 \\cdot 12 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}$. Since we want to find the inverse of 12, we can swap the roles of 4 and 12 to get $12 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}$. This implies that the inverse of 12 is 4.\n\n**Part 6: Finding the Inverse of 35**\n\nFinally, we can use the fact that the inverse of 12 is 4 to find the inverse of 35. Since $35 \\equiv -12 \\pmod{47}$, we can conclude that the inverse of 35 is also 4, because $(-12) \\cdot 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}$ implies $35 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}$.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe modular inverse of 35 modulo 47 is 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 4."
