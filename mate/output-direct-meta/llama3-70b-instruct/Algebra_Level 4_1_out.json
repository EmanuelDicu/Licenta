To tackle this, let's try to simplify the expression by noticing that the inner square root is the same as the outer square root:\n\n$$\\sqrt{x + E} = E$$\n\nThis step is crucial, as it allows us to get rid of the infinite recursion.\n\n**Simplifying the equation**\n\nNow, let's square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root:\n\n$$x + E = E^2$$\n\nSubtract $E$ from both sides to isolate the term with $x$:\n\n$$x = E^2 - E$$\n\n**Substituting the given value**\n\nWe are given that $E = 5$, so let's substitute this value into our equation:\n\n$$x = 5^2 - 5$$\n\n**Simplifying and solving for x**\n\nNow, it's just a matter of simplifying the right-hand side:\n\n$$x = 25 - 5 = 20$$\n\n**The solution**\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ for which $\\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + \\ldots}}} = 5$ is $\\boxed{20}$.\n\nI hope this step-by-step solution helps you understand how to approach this problem!"
