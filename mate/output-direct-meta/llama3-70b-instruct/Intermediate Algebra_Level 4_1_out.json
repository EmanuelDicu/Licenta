            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them step by step.\n\n**Part 1: Understanding the Equation of the Hyperbola**\n\nThe given equation of the hyperbola is:\n\n\\[\\frac{(y - k)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(x - h)^2}{b^2} = 1.\\]\n\nWe know that the center of the hyperbola is at the point $(h, k)$. From the graph, we can see that the center is at $(6, -5)$, so we can set $h = 6$ and $k = -5$.\n\n**Part 2: Finding the Values of $a$ and $b$**\n\nFrom the graph, we can see that the hyperbola opens in the vertical direction, which means that the transverse axis is vertical. The length of the transverse axis is $2a$, and the distance from the center to the asymptotes is $b$.\n\nFrom the graph, we can see that the asymptotes intersect at the point $(6, -5)$. The slopes of the asymptotes are $\\pm \\frac{b}{a}$. Since the asymptotes are perpendicular to each other, we can conclude that $\\frac{b}{a} = 2$. This gives us $b = 2a$.\n\nThe hyperbola intersects the $y$-axis at the point $(6, -1)$. Substituting $x = 6$ and $y = -1$ into the equation of the hyperbola, we get:\n\n\\[\\frac{(-1 - (-5))^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(6 - 6)^2}{b^2} = 1.\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[\\frac{16}{a^2} = 1 \\Rightarrow a^2 = 16.\\]\n\nSince $a$ is positive, we can take $a = 4$. Now, we can find $b$ using $b = 2a$:\n\n\\[b = 2(4) = 8.\\]\n\n**Part 3: Calculating the Sum**\n\nNow that we have found the values of $h, k, a$, and $b$, we can calculate the sum $h + k + a + b$:\n\n\\[h + k + a + b = 6 + (-5) + 4 + 8 = \\boxed{13}.\\]\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is 13."
