        "correct_solution": "Notice that for each integer $n$ satisfying $1 \\le n \\le 19, n \\neq 10$, then using the sum of cubes factorization, $n^3 + (20 - n)^3 = (n + 20 - n)(n^2 + (20-n)n + (20-n)^2)$ $ = 20(n^2 + (20-n)n + (20-n)^2)$. Thus, we can pair each integer with the difference between $20$ and that integer, and the sum of their cubes is divisible by $20$. Hence, the units digit of the sum of the first $19$ cubes, excluding $10$, is equal to $0$. Also, the units digits of $10^3$ and $20^3$ are clearly $0$, so we just need to find the units digit of the cube of $21$, which is $\\boxed{1}$.",

This means we need to find the last digit of the sum of the cubes of the first 21 positive integers.\n\n**Step 2: Break down the problem into smaller parts**\n\nLet's start by finding the units digit of each perfect cube individually. We can do this by considering the units digit of each positive integer raised to the power of 3.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the units digit of perfect cubes**\n\nNotice that when we cube a number, the units digit of the result depends only on the units digit of the original number. For example:\n\n* If the units digit is 0, 1, 5, or 6, the units digit of the cube is the same (0, 1, 5, or 6, respectively).\n* If the units digit is 2, 3, 7, or 8, the units digit of the cube is 8, 7, 3, or 2, respectively.\n* If the units digit is 4, the units digit of the cube is 4.\n* If the units digit is 9, the units digit of the cube is 9.\n\nThis pattern can be summarized as follows:\n\n| Units digit of original number | Units digit of cube |\n| --- | --- |\n| 0, 1, 5, 6 | 0, 1, 5, 6 |\n| 2, 3, 7, 8 | 8, 7, 3, 2 |\n| 4 | 4 |\n| 9 | 9 |\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the sum of the units digits of the first 21 positive perfect cubes**\n\nUsing the analysis above, we can find the units digit of each perfect cube:\n\n| Cube | Units digit |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1^3 | 1 |\n| 2^3 | 8 |\n| 3^3 | 7 |\n| 4^3 | 4 |\n| 5^3 | 5 |\n| 6^3 | 6 |\n| 7^3 | 3 |\n| 8^3 | 2 |\n| 9^3 | 9 |\n| 10^3 | 0 |\n| 11^3 | 1 |\n| 12^3 | 8 |\n| 13^3 | 7 |\n| 14^3 | 4 |\n| 15^3 | 5 |\n| 16^3 | 6 |\n| 17^3 | 3 |\n| 18^3 | 2 |\n| 19^3 | 9 |\n| 20^3 | 0 |\n| 21^3 | 1 |\n\nNow, let's add up the units digits:\n\n1 + 8 + 7 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 3 + 2 + 9 + 0 + 1 + 8 + 7 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 3 + 2 + 9 + 0 + 1 = 81\n\nThe units digit of the sum is 1.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nThe units digit of the sum of the first 21 positive perfect cubes is 1.\n\nThe solution to the problem is: The units digit is 1."
