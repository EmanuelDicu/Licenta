Let's do that by subtracting 4 from both sides:\n\n$-11x + 4 - 4 = 32 - 4$\n\nThis gives us: $-11x = 28$\n\n**Step 4: Solve for $x$**\n\nFinally, let's divide both sides by -11 to solve for $x$:\n\n$-11x / -11 = 28 / -11$\n\n$x = -28/11$\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ in the equation $5x - 3x + 4(1-4x) = 32$ is **$x = -28/11$**.\n\nThat's the solution!"
