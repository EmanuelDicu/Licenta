We need to find the value of $x$ by analyzing the given diagram.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the angles**\n\nThe diagram shows multiple angles, but we can identify three main angles:\n\n* The angle formed by the two rays $\\overline{PQ}$ and $\\overleftrightarrow{PX}$ (where $X$ is the point where the ray intersects the horizontal line) is $x^\\circ$.\n* The angle formed by the two rays $\\overline{PQ}$ and $\\overleftrightarrow{PY}$ (where $Y$ is the point where the ray intersects the horizontal line) is also $x^\\circ$.\n* The angle formed by the two rays $\\overline{PX}$ and $\\overline{PY}$ is also $x^\\circ$.\n\n**Step 3: Recognize the properties of straight lines and angles**\n\nWe know that the sum of the angles formed by two intersecting lines is $180^\\circ$. Since $PQ$ is a straight line, the sum of the angles formed by the rays $\\overline{PX}$, $\\overline{PY}$, and $\\overline{PQ}$ is $180^\\circ$.\n\n**Step 4: Set up the equation**\n\nWe can set up an equation using the properties of straight lines and angles:\n\n$$x + x + x = 180$$\n\n**Step 5: Solve for $x$**\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$$3x = 180$$\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n$$x = 60$$\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe value of $x$ is $60^\\circ$."
