        "correct_solution": "For there to be infinite solutions, the first equation needs to be consistent with the second and yet add no new information, which means it must be a multiple of the second. Since the coefficient of $y$ in the first equation is twice that of $y$ in the second equation, the multiplier is 2. This implies that the first equation must be $2(5x+y)=2(-3)$. After equating coefficients, this gives $2a=2\\cdot5$ and $b=2\\cdot-3$, or $(a,b)=\\boxed{(5,-6)}$.",

            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them logically.\n\n**Part 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe problem asks us to find the ordered pair $(a, b)$ for which there are infinite solutions $(x, y)$ to the given system of linear equations. This means that we need to find the values of $a$ and $b$ that make the system have infinitely many solutions.\n\n**Part 2: Analyzing the System of Equations**\n\nLet's analyze the given system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2ax + 2y &= b,\\\\\n5x + y &= -3.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can see that this is a system of two linear equations in two variables, $x$ and $y$. For there to be infinite solutions, the two equations must be equivalent, meaning they represent the same line.\n\n**Part 3: Making the Equations Equivalent**\n\nTo make the equations equivalent, we can try to eliminate one of the variables. Let's eliminate $y$ by multiplying the second equation by $-2$ and adding it to the first equation:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2ax + 2y &= b,\\\\\n-10x - 2y &= 6. &(Multiply second equation by -2)\n\\end{align*}\n\nAdding the two equations, we get:\n\n$$(2a - 10)x = b - 6.$$\n\n**Part 4: Analyzing the Result**\n\nNow, we want the system to have infinite solutions, which means the equations must be equivalent. For this to happen, the coefficients of $x$ must be equal, and the constants must be equal. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2a - 10 &= 0,\\\\\nb - 6 &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\n\n**Part 5: Solving for $a$ and $b$**\n\nSolving the first equation, we get:\n\n$$2a - 10 = 0 \\Rightarrow 2a = 10 \\Rightarrow a = 5.$$\n\nSolving the second equation, we get:\n\n$$b - 6 = 0 \\Rightarrow b = 6.$$\n\n**Part 6: Writing the Solution**\n\nTherefore, the ordered pair $(a, b)$ for which there are infinite solutions $(x, y)$ to the given system is:\n\n$$(a, b) = (5, 6).$$\n\nThis is the solution to the problem."
