We'll multiply -13 by each term inside the parentheses:\n\n$$-13(r+5) = -13r - 65$$\n\nSo, the inequality becomes:\n\n$$-13r - 65 + 25 > 4(r-10)$$\n\n**Step 2: Combine like terms on the left side of the inequality**\n\nWe have two constant terms on the left side: -65 and 25. Let's combine them:\n\n$$-13r - 40 > 4(r-10)$$\n\n**Step 3: Distribute the 4 to the terms inside the parentheses on the right side**\n\nWe'll multiply 4 by each term inside the parentheses:\n\n$$4(r-10) = 4r - 40$$\n\nSo, the inequality becomes:\n\n$$-13r - 40 > 4r - 40$$\n\n**Step 4: Add 40 to both sides of the inequality**\n\nOur goal is to get rid of the -40 term on the left side. We'll add 40 to both sides:\n\n$$-13r > 4r$$\n\n**Step 5: Add 13r to both sides of the inequality**\n\nWe'll add 13r to both sides to get all the r terms on one side:\n\n$$0 > 17r$$\n\n**Step 6: Divide both sides of the inequality by -17**\n\nWe'll divide both sides by -17 to solve for r. Note that when we divide by a negative number, the inequality sign flips:\n\n$$r < 0$$\n\n**Step 7: Express the solution in interval notation**\n\nThe solution to the inequality is all values of r less than 0. We can express this in interval notation as:\n\n$$(-\\infty, 0)$$\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is $$(-\\infty, 0)$$."
