        "correct_solution": "We have $g(4) = \\sqrt{2(4) + 1} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$, so $f(g(4)) = f(3) = 3^2 -2(3) +1 = 4$.  Since $f(3) = 4$, we have $g(f(3)) = g(4) = \\sqrt{2(4) + 1} = 3$.  Therefore, $f(g(4)) -g(f(3)) = 4-3 = \\boxed{1}$.\n\n\nNotice that $f(g(4)) = 4$ and $g(f(3)) = 3$.  Is that a coincidence?",

            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them in a logical order.\n\n**Step 1: Evaluate g(4)**\n\nWe are given g(x) = \u221a(2x+1). We need to find g(4), which means we need to substitute x = 4 into the function g(x).\n\ng(4) = \u221a(2(4)+1)\n= \u221a(8+1)\n= \u221a9\n= 3 (since \u221a9 = 3)\n\nSo, g(4) = 3.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate f(g(4))**\n\nNow that we have g(4) = 3, we need to find f(g(4)) = f(3). We are given f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 1. We need to substitute x = 3 into the function f(x).\n\nf(3) = (3)\u00b2 - 2(3) + 1\n= 9 - 6 + 1\n= 4\n\nSo, f(g(4)) = f(3) = 4.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate f(3)**\n\nWe already did this in Step 2! f(3) = 4.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate g(f(3))**\n\nNow that we have f(3) = 4, we need to find g(f(3)) = g(4). Wait, didn't we do this already in Step 1? Yes, we did! g(4) = 3.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate f(g(4)) - g(f(3))**\n\nNow that we have f(g(4)) = 4 and g(f(3)) = 3, we can calculate the final answer:\n\nf(g(4)) - g(f(3)) = 4 - 3\n= 1\n\nThus, the solution to the problem is **1**."
