        "correct_solution": "The only way for the Dora to end up at her starting point in four steps is for her to traverse the four sides of the gray square.  She can do this in two ways: clockwise and counterclockwise. The probability of each of these two paths is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^4=\\frac{1}{256}$.  Therefore, the probability that she ends up where she started is $\\dfrac{1}{256}+\\dfrac{1}{256}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{128}}$.",

            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them logically.\n\n**Part 1: Define the Possible Paths**\n\nDora starts at point $A$ and takes 4 steps. At each intersection, she has a choice of 2 directions (left or right, up or down). Therefore, there are a total of $2^4 = 16$ possible paths Dora can take.\n\n**Part 2: Identify the Desired Outcome**\n\nWe want to find the probability that Dora walks completely around the gray square. This means she must end up back at point $A$ after 4 steps.\n\n**Part 3: Analyze the Possible Paths**\n\nLet's analyze the possible paths that bring Dora back to point $A$ after 4 steps. We can do this by drawing the possible paths:\n\n[asy]\nsize(100);\nfill((1,1)--(1,2)--(2,2)--(2,1)--cycle, gray(.6));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,0)--cycle, linewidth(1.5));\ndraw((0,1)--(3,1), linewidth(1.5));\ndraw((0,2)--(3,2), linewidth(1.5));\ndraw((1,0)--(1,3), linewidth(1.5));\ndraw((2,0)--(2,3), linewidth(1.5));\ndot(MP(\"A\", (1,2), NW));\ndraw((1,2)--(1,3)--(2,3)--(2,2)--(1,2), dashed);\ndraw((1,2)--(2,2)--(2,1)--(1,1)--(1,2), dashed);\ndraw((1,2)--(1,1)--(2,1)--(2,2)--(1,2), dashed);\ndraw((1,2)--(2,2)--(2,3)--(1,3)--(1,2), dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nThere are 4 possible paths that bring Dora back to point $A$:\n\n1. Up-Right-Down-Left\n2. Up-Left-Down-Right\n3. Down-Right-Up-Left\n4. Down-Left-Up-Right\n\n**Part 4: Calculate the Probability**\n\nEach of the 16 possible paths has an equal probability of occurrence (since Dora selects each direction with equal probability). Therefore, the probability of Dora walking completely around the gray square is the number of desired outcomes (4) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (16):\n\n$$P(\\text{walking around gray square}) = \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe probability that, in her first four steps, Dora will walk completely around the gray square is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$."
