Since $\\overline{BC}\\cong\\overline{DC}$, $\\triangle BCD$ is a 45-45-90 right triangle, which means the hypotenuse has a length of $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of each leg. So $BD=x\\sqrt{2}$. Since $\\triangle ABD$ is an isosceles triangle, we know that drawing a segment from $A$ to the midpoint of $\\overline{BD}$ splits the triangles into two congruent right triangles. Each right triangle has a hypotenuse of length $x$ and a leg of length $\\frac{BD}{2}=\\frac{x\\sqrt{2}}{2}=\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Notice that the hypotenuse has a length of $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of the bottom leg, which means the triangle is another 45-45-90 right triangle.

            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them logically.\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the key properties of the pyramid**\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that the pyramid has a square base and all eight of its edges are the same length. This means that the base ABCD is a square, and each edge of the pyramid (such as AB, BC, CD, DA, AE, BE, CE, and DE) has the same length.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying the key angle**\n\nWe need to find the degree measure of angle ABD. To do this, we can start by identifying the key angle that will help us find the measure of ABD.\n\nLet's focus on triangle ABE. Since AE = BE (because all edges have the same length), we can conclude that triangle ABE is isosceles. This means that the two base angles, AEB and ABE, are equal.\n\n**Part 3: Finding the measure of angle ABE**\n\nSince the base ABCD is a square, we know that each interior angle of the square measures 90 degrees. Therefore, angle AED measures 90 degrees.\n\nNow, consider triangle AED. Since AE = ED (because all edges have the same length), we can apply the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) congruence criterion to conclude that triangle AED is congruent to triangle ABE.\n\nThis means that angle ABE = angle AED = 90 degrees.\n\n**Part 4: Finding the measure of angle ABD**\n\nNow that we know the measure of angle ABE, we can use this information to find the measure of angle ABD.\n\nConsider triangle ABD. Since AB = AD (because all edges have the same length), we can apply the Angle-Angle-Side (AAS) similarity criterion to conclude that triangle ABD is similar to triangle ABE.\n\nThis means that the corresponding angles in these triangles are equal. Specifically, angle ABD = angle ABE = 90 degrees.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe degree measure of angle ABD is 90 degrees.\n\nIn summary, we broke down the problem into smaller parts, identified the key properties of the pyramid, used the isosceles triangle property to find the measure of angle ABE, and then used similarity to find the measure of angle ABD. The final solution is that angle ABD measures 90 degrees."
