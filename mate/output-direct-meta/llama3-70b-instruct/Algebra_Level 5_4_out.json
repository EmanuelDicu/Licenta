        "correct_solution": "Let the first term be $a$.  Because the sum of the series is 45, we have $45= a/[1-(-1/2)] = a/(3/2) = 2a/3$.  Therefore, $a=\\boxed{\\frac{135}{2}}$.",

We need to find the first term of the series.\n\n**Part 2: Formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series**\n\nThe formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is:\n\nS = a / (1 - r)\n\nwhere S is the sum, a is the first term, and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this problem, we are given S = 45 and r = -1/2. We need to find a.\n\n**Part 3: Plug in the values and simplify**\n\nPlug in the values into the formula:\n\n45 = a / (1 - (-1/2))\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\n45 = a / (1 + 1/2)\n45 = a / (3/2)\n\n**Part 4: Solve for a**\n\nMultiply both sides by the denominator to get:\n\n45 \u00d7 (3/2) = a\n\nSimplify:\n\n135/2 = a\n\n**Part 5: Write the final answer**\n\nThe first term of the series is:\n\na = 135/2\na = 67.5\n\nSo, the solution to the problem is that the first term of the series is 67.5.\n\nNote: Since the problem states that the series has a common ratio of -1/2, we know that the series is convergent, and the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is applicable."
