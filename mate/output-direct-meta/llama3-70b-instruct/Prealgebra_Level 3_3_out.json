            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them step by step.\n\n**Part 1: Finding the area of rectangle ABCD**\n\nThe problem states that the area of rectangle ABCD is 40. To find the area of a rectangle, we need to multiply the length by the width. Let's identify the length and width of rectangle ABCD.\n\nFrom the diagram, we can see that the length of rectangle ABCD is 8 (from point B to point A) and the width is 5 (from point A to point D). Therefore, the area of rectangle ABCD is:\n\nArea = Length \u00d7 Width = 8 \u00d7 5 = 40\n\nThis confirms the given information.\n\n**Part 2: Finding the area of rectangle MBCN**\n\nTo find the area of rectangle MBCN, we need to find its length and width. Let's analyze the diagram:\n\n* The length of rectangle MBCN is the same as the distance between points M and B, which is 4 (from point M to point B).\n* The width of rectangle MBCN is the same as the distance between points N and C, which is 2 (from point N to point C).\n\nNow, we can find the area of rectangle MBCN:\n\nArea = Length \u00d7 Width = 4 \u00d7 2 = 8\n\nTherefore, the area of rectangle MBCN is 8.\n\nThe solution to the problem is:\n\nThe area of rectangle MBCN is 8."
