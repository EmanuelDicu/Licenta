We can do this by multiplying the two complex numbers using the distributive property:\n\n$$ab = (5 - 8i)(30 + 48i)$$\n\nExpanding the product, we get:\n\n$$ab = 150 + 240i - 240i - 384i^2$$\n\nSince $i^2 = -1$, we can simplify the expression:\n\n$$ab = 150 - 384(-1) = 150 + 384 = 534$$\n\nSo, $ab = 534$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the absolute value of ab**\n\nNow that we have found $ab$, we can find its absolute value, $|ab|$. The absolute value of a complex number is its distance from the origin in the complex plane. Since $ab$ is a real number (it has no imaginary part), its absolute value is simply its magnitude:\n\n$$|ab| = |534| = 534$$\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is $|ab| = \\boxed{534}$.\n\nIn summary, we broke down the problem into two parts: finding the product $ab$ and then finding its absolute value. By multiplying the two complex numbers and simplifying the expression, we found that $ab = 534$. Finally, we found the absolute value of $ab$, which is also $534$."
