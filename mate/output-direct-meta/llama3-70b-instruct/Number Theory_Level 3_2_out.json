In other words, we need to find an integer $n$ such that $7n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{398}$.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the definition of modular multiplicative inverse**\nA modular multiplicative inverse of $a$ modulo $m$ is an integer $x$ such that $ax \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$. In our case, $a=7$ and $m=398$.\n\n**Step 3: Use the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7 and 398**\nTo find the modular multiplicative inverse, we need to find the GCD of 7 and 398 using the Euclidean Algorithm.\n\n```\n398 = 7(56) + 14\n7 = 14(0) + 7\n14 = 7(2) + 0\n```\n\nThe GCD of 7 and 398 is 7.\n\n**Step 4: Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular multiplicative inverse**\nSince the GCD of 7 and 398 is 7, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular multiplicative inverse.\n\nLet's rewrite the equations from the Euclidean Algorithm:\n\n```\n14 = 398 - 7(56)\n7 = 7 - 14(0)\n```\n\nNow, we can express 7 as a linear combination of 7 and 398:\n\n```\n7 = 398(-56) + 7(1)\n```\n\nReducing modulo 398, we get:\n\n```\n7n \u2261 1 (mod 398) => n \u2261 -56 (mod 398)\n```\n\n**Step 5: Find the smallest positive integer solution**\nTo find the smallest positive integer solution, we add 398 to -56 until we get a positive number less than 398:\n\n```\n-56 + 398 = 342\n```\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is:\n\n**n = 57**\n\nThis is because 57 is the smallest positive integer such that $7(57) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{398}$.\n\nI hope this step-by-step solution helps!"
