        "correct_solution": "Recall that for positive integers $a$ and $b$ $x^a x^b = x^{a+b}$.  Thus, if $h(x)$, $f(x)$, and $g(x)$ are polynomials such that $h(x)=f(x) \\cdot g(x)$ and if $ x^a $ and $ x^b $ are the highest degree terms of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ then the highest degree term of $h(x)$ will be $x^{a+b}$.  In our case $f(x) = x^2-7x+10$, the highest degree term is $x^2$ and $h(x)$ has highest degree term $x^5$.  Thus, solving for $b$ in the equation $x^5 = x^2 x^b = x^{2+b}$, we find $b=\\boxed{3}$.",

            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them step by step.\n\n**Part 1: Understanding the given information**\n\nWe are given a polynomial $h(x)$ of degree 5, which means the highest power of $x$ in $h(x)$ is 5. We are also given that $h(x) = (x^2-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$, where $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $b$. This tells us that $h(x)$ can be expressed as the product of two polynomials: $(x^2-7x+10)$ and $g(x)$.\n\n**Part 2: Analyzing the degree of the polynomial $(x^2-7x+10)$**\n\nThe polynomial $(x^2-7x+10)$ has a degree of 2, since the highest power of $x$ in this polynomial is 2.\n\n**Part 3: Relating the degrees of $h(x)$ and $g(x)$**\n\nSince $h(x) = (x^2-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$, the degree of $h(x)$ must be the sum of the degrees of the two polynomials being multiplied. In other words, the degree of $h(x)$ is the sum of the degree of $(x^2-7x+10)$ and the degree of $g(x)$.\n\nMathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\ndegree of $h(x)$ = degree of $(x^2-7x+10)$ + degree of $g(x)$\n5 = 2 + $b$\n\n**Part 4: Solving for $b$**\n\nNow, we can solve for $b$ by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:\n\n$b$ = 5 - 2\n$b$ = 3\n\n**The solution to the problem**\n\n Therefore, the degree of the polynomial $g(x)$ is $b=3$."
