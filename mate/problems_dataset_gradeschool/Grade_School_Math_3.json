    "problem": "John Henry is competing against a machine to see who can dig a tunnel more quickly. John works without rest, and excavates at a rate of 6 cubic feet of rock per hour. The machine excavates more quickly but needs to be refueled and maintained by its operator for 30 minutes out of every hour. When itâ€™s not under maintenance, the machine excavates at a rate of 10 cubic feet of stone per hour. Provided that the competition lasts for 8 hours, how much more rock will John have excavated compared to the machine?",
