    "problem": "Gabriela has $65.00 and is shopping for groceries so that her grandmother can make her favorite kale soup. She needs heavy cream, kale, cauliflower, and meat (bacon and sausage). Gabriella spends 40% of her money on the meat. She spends $5.00 less than one-third of the remaining money on heavy cream. Cauliflower costs three-fourth of the price of the heavy cream and the kale costs $2.00 less than the cauliflower. As Gabriela leaves the store, she spends one-third of her remaining money on her grandmotherâ€™s favorite Girl Scout Cookies. How much money, in dollars, does Gabriela spend on Girl Scout cookies?",
