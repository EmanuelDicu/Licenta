        "correct_solution": "We know that the number of subsets of any given set is equal to $2^n,$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the set. First, then, we need to find the number of composite divisors. The prime factorization of $72$ is $72=2^3 \\cdot 3^2,$ so there are $(3+1)(2+1)=12$ total divisors. (To see this, note that we can form a divisor of the form $2^a 3^b$ by freely choosing $a=0,1,2,3$ and $b=0,1,2$). Of these, $1$ is neither prime nor composite, and $2$ and $3$ are prime, for a total of $9$ composite divisors. Therefore there are $2^9=\\boxed{512}$ subsets of the divisors of $72$ with only composite divisors.",

A composite number has more than two factors (including 1 and itself).\nStep 4:\nThe composite divisors of 72 are 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.\nStep 5:\nWe need to find the number of subsets that can be formed using these composite divisors. \nStep 6:\nSince each of these 9 composite divisors can either be included or not included in a subset, there are 2 options for each divisor.\nStep 7:\nTherefore, there are a total of 2^9 = 512 subsets that can be formed using only composite divisors. However, this includes the case where we don't include any of the composite divisors, which is the empty set.\nStep 8:\nSince we want to include the empty set in our count, our final answer is 512.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{512} \n```"
