        "correct_solution": "Instead of adding up scores and figuring out the new averages, a quicker way (useful for the countdown round) is as follows:\n\nSince the average is 90, we first calculate how many points below 90 he already is: he's scored 87, 85, and 87, meaning that he is 3, 5, and 3 points below 90 respectively, making for a total of 11 points below.  We then know that his remaining two tests must be a combined 11 points above 90, and since they differ by 3 points, we know that one test is 4 above 90, and the other is 7 above 90, meaning his highest score was $\\boxed{97}$.",

            "gemini-1.5-pro": "```\nSolution:\nStep 1:\nEd's target total score is $90\\%$ of $500$ points (5 tests x 100 points/test), or $0.90 \\times 500 = 450$ points.\nWe do this because we know Ed's average score is 90% and he takes 5 tests that are worth 100 points each.\n\nStep 2:\nEd's total score on the first three tests is $87 + 85 + 87 = 259$ points.\nThis is calculated by adding the scores he got in the first three tests.\n\nStep 3:\nEd needs $450 - 259 = 191$ points on his last two tests to reach his target total score.\nThis is calculated by subtracting his current score (259) from his target score (450).\n\nStep 4:\nLet $x$ be Ed's higher score on his last two tests.\nWe introduce a variable that represents Ed's higher score to make it easier to set up an equation. \n\nStep 5:\nEd's lower score on his last two tests is $x - 3$.\nBecause we know his last two scores differ by 3 points.\n\nStep 6:\nThe total score for his last two tests is $x + (x - 3) = 191$ points.\nThis equation represents the sum of his last two test scores, which we know must equal 191. \n\nStep 7:\nCombining like terms, we get  $2x - 3 = 191$.\nHere we simplified the equation from the previous step.\n\nStep 8:\nAdding 3 to both sides, we have $2x = 194$.\nWe are isolating the x variable to solve for it.\n\nStep 9:\nDividing both sides by 2, we find $x = 97$.\nThis gives us Ed's higher score on the last two tests.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{97}\n```"
