Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that are only divisible by 1 and themselves.\nStep 2:\nThe prime numbers less than 40 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37.\nStep 3:\nTo get the largest possible product, we need to multiply the two largest prime numbers from our list. Those are 29 and 37.\nStep 4:\nMultiplying 29 by 37, we get 29 * 37 = 1073. \nStep 5:\nTherefore, the greatest possible product of two distinct prime numbers less than 40 is 1073. \nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{1073}\n```"
