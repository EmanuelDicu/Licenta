Let's represent this entire expression with the variable 'y':\ny = \u221a(x + \u221a(x + \u221a(x + ...))) \nStep 2: Since the pattern repeats infinitely, we can substitute the entire expression 'y' back into the equation for the nested radical:\ny = \u221a(x + y)\nStep 3: Now we have a simpler equation. Let's solve for 'y':\ny\u00b2 = x + y\ny\u00b2 - y - x = 0\nStep 4: We are given that the value of the infinite expression (which we represented as 'y') is equal to 5. Substitute 'y = 5' into the equation:\n5\u00b2 - 5 - x = 0\n25 - 5 - x = 0\n20 - x = 0\nStep 5: Isolate 'x' to find its value:\nx = 20\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{20} \n```"
