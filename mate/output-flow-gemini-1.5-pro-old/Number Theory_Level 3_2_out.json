This means we need to find 'n' such that the following equation holds true:\n7n \u2261 1 (mod 398)\nStep 2:\nThis equation implies that 7n leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 398. We can rewrite this equation as:\n7n = 398k + 1\nwhere k is an integer.\nStep 3:\nWe can solve for 'n' by trying to find an integer 'k' that satisfies the equation. We can start by simplifying the equation:\n7n - 398k = 1\nNotice that 398 = 7 * 57.  We can use this to rewrite the equation:\n7n - 7 * 57k = 1\n7(n - 57k) = 1\nStep 4:\nTo make the left side of the equation equal to 1, the expression (n - 57k) must equal 1.  We can achieve this by setting k = -1 and n = -56:\n7(-56 - 57 * -1) = 1\n7(-56 + 57) = 1\n7(1) = 1\nStep 5:\nSince we need 0 \u2264 n < 398, we add 398 to -56:\nn = -56 + 398 = 342\nTherefore, the integer 'n' that satisfies the given conditions is 342.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{342}\n```"
