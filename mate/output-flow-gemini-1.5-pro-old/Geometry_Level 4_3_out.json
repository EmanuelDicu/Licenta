Since all sides of a square are equal, we can calculate the distance between any two adjacent vertices. \n\nStep 2:\nLet's find the distance between the vertices (-2, 2) and (-2, -6) using the distance formula:\n\n\u221a((-2 - (-2))^2 + ((-6) - 2)^2) = \u221a(0^2 + (-8)^2) = \u221a64 = 8\n\nStep 3:\nNow that we have the side length, we can calculate the area of the square by squaring the side length: 8^2 = 64.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{64}\n```"
