Substitute this value into the equation for the real parts: x + \u221a(x\u00b2 + 8\u00b2) = 2\n\nStep 6:\nSimplify and solve for x: \nx + \u221a(x\u00b2 + 64) = 2 \n\u221a(x\u00b2 + 64) = 2 - x \nx\u00b2 + 64 = 4 - 4x + x\u00b2\n4x = -60\nx = -15\n\nStep 7:\nHowever, we need to check if this solution is valid. Substituting x = -15 and y = 8 back into the equation x + \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 2, we get -15 + \u221a((-15)\u00b2 + 8\u00b2) = -15 + 17 = 2. This is consistent with the equation.\n\nTherefore, the complex number z is x + yi = -15 + 8i.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{-15 + 8i} \n\"\"\"\n```"
