        "problem": "In Mathopolis, an adult is a person 21 years of age or older and a child is a person under 21 years of age.  Exactly half of the  adults in Mathopolis are female, and exactly half of the female  adults have exactly one biological child.  Nobody else has a  child, and there are no other children.  What percent of the  people of Mathopolis are children?",
        "correct_solution": "Let the percentage of people in Mathopolis who are children be $x$. The percentage of adults is then $1-x$. Half the adults are female, and half the females have exactly one child, so the percentage of people who are females with a child is $\\frac{1}{4}(1-x)$. This percentage is equal to the percentage of children, since there is a correspondence between a mother and a child. So we have the equation $x=\\frac{1}{4}(1-x)$. Solving for $x$ yields $x=1/5$, or $\\boxed{20}$ percent.",

            "gemini-1.5-pro": "```\nSolution:\nStep 1: \nLet's assume there are 100 adults in Mathopolis.\nThis assumption will make it easier to work with percentages.\nStep 2:\nSince half of the adults are female, there are 100 adults / 2 = 50 female adults in Mathopolis.\nStep 3:\nHalf of the female adults have one child, meaning 50 female adults / 2 = 25 female adults have one child each.\nStep 4:\nBecause only these female adults have children, and each of them has one child, there are 25 children in Mathopolis.\nStep 5:\nThe total population of Mathopolis is the number of children plus the number of adults, which is 25 children + 100 adults = 125 people.\nStep 6:\nThe percentage of children in Mathopolis is (25 children / 125 total people) * 100% = 20%.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{20\\%}\n```"
