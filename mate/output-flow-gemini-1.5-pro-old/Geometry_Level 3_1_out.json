We are given that the volume of the sphere is \u03c0/6 cubic inches. So we can set up the equation: (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 = \u03c0/6.\n\nStep 2: To find the radius of the sphere, we can solve the equation from Step 1 for r. \nDividing both sides by \u03c0 gives us: (4/3)r\u00b3 = 1/6.\nMultiplying both sides by 3/4 gives us: r\u00b3 = 1/8.\nTaking the cube root of both sides gives us: r = 1/2.\n\nStep 3: Since the sphere is inscribed in the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube. The diameter is twice the radius, so the side length of the cube is 2 * (1/2) = 1 inch.\n\nStep 4: The volume of a cube is given by the formula s\u00b3, where s is the side length of the cube.  Therefore, the volume of the cube is 1\u00b3 = 1 cubic inch.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{1}\n```"
