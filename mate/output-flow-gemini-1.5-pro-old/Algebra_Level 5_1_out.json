The GCF of 36 and  -4 is 4.\nStep 2: Factoring out the GCF, we get:  $4(9 - x^2)$.\nStep 3: The expression inside the parentheses is in the form of $a^2 - b^2$,  where $a = 3$ and  $b = x$. This is a difference of squares pattern.\nStep 4: We can factor the difference of squares as follows: $a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)$.\nStep 5: Applying this pattern to our expression, we get: $4(3 + x)(3 - x)$.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{4(3 + x)(3 - x)} \n```"
