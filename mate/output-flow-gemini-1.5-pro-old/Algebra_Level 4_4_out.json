        "correct_solution": "For there to be infinite solutions, the first equation needs to be consistent with the second and yet add no new information, which means it must be a multiple of the second. Since the coefficient of $y$ in the first equation is twice that of $y$ in the second equation, the multiplier is 2. This implies that the first equation must be $2(5x+y)=2(-3)$. After equating coefficients, this gives $2a=2\\cdot5$ and $b=2\\cdot-3$, or $(a,b)=\\boxed{(5,-6)}$.",

This results in the graphs of the equations coinciding, representing the same line.\n\nStep 2:  To make the coefficients of 'y' in both equations the same, we multiply the second equation by 2:\n   10x + 2y = -6\n\nStep 3: Now we have the system:\n   2ax + 2y = b\n   10x + 2y = -6 \n\nStep 4: For the equations to represent the same line, the coefficients of 'x' and the constant terms must also be proportional.  \n\nStep 5: We set up the following proportionality: \n   2a/10 = b/-6\n\nStep 6: Simplifying the proportionality, we get:\n    a/5 = b/-6\n\nStep 7:  We can express this relationship as:\n    a = 5k and b = -6k, where k is any real number\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the ordered pair (a, b) that leads to an infinite number of solutions is (5k, -6k), where k is any real number.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{(5k,-6k)} \n```"
