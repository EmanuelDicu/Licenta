To do this, we'll first rearrange the equation into standard quadratic form.\nStep 2:\nSubtracting $41t$ from both sides of the equation gives us: $6t^2 - 41t + 30 = 0$.\nStep 3:\nNow we can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for 't'. The quadratic formula states that for an equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions are given by: \n$x = \\dfrac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\nStep 4:\nIn our equation, $a = 6$, $b = -41$, and $c = 30$. Substituting these values into the quadratic formula gives us:\n$t = \\dfrac{-(-41) \\pm \\sqrt{(-41)^2 - 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 30}}{2 \\cdot 6}$\nStep 5:\nSimplifying the expression under the radical and the denominator:\n$t = \\dfrac{41 \\pm \\sqrt{1681 - 720}}{12}$\nStep 6:\nFurther simplification:\n$t = \\dfrac{41 \\pm \\sqrt{961}}{12}$\n$t = \\dfrac{41 \\pm 31}{12}$\nStep 7:\nThis gives us two possible solutions:\n$t_1 = \\dfrac{41 + 31}{12} = \\dfrac{72}{12} = 6$\n$t_2 = \\dfrac{41 - 31}{12} = \\dfrac{10}{12} = \\dfrac{5}{6}$\nStep 8:\nFinally, we need to find the positive difference between these two solutions:\n$6 - \\dfrac{5}{6} = \\dfrac{36}{6} - \\dfrac{5}{6} = \\dfrac{31}{6}$\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{31}{6}}\n```"
