To see this, consider the bottom-left vertex of such a square. It can be at any of the 9 points $(1,1), (1,2), \\dots, (3,3)$.\nStep 4:\nSimilarly, there are $2 \\times 2 = 4$ squares of side length 2, and $1\\times 1 = 1$ square of side length 3. \nStep 5:\nFinally, there is $1$ square of side length 4.\nStep 6:\nIn total, there are $16 + 9 + 4 + 1 + 1 =  \\boxed{31}$ squares.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{31}\n```"
