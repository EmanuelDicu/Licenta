Notice that there are squares with side length 1, side length 2, side length 3, and side length 4 on the grid. \nStep 2:\nThere are 4 x 4 = 16 squares of side length 1.\nStep 3:\nThere are 3 x 3 = 9 squares of side length 2.\nStep 4:\nThere are 2 x 2 = 4 squares of side length 3.\nStep 5:\nThere is 1 x 1 = 1 square of side length 4.\nStep 6:\nWe also need to consider tilted squares, like the one shown in the example.\nStep 7:\nConsider a square with one vertex at the point (1,0). There are 2 tilted squares with this vertex: one with a side length of sqrt(2), and one with a side length of 2*sqrt(2).  Since any of the 16 dots can be the vertex of such a square (except the dots in the top row and rightmost column, because the tilted squares extending from those points would extend past the grid), there are a total of 9*2 = 18 more squares. \nStep 8:\nTherefore, there are a total of 16 + 9 + 4 + 1 + 18 = 48 squares.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{48}\n```"
