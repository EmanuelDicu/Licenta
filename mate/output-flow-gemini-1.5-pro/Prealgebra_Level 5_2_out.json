This means that the two legs of the triangle are congruent and the altitude to the hypotenuse bisects the hypotenuse. \n\nStep 2:\nLet's denote the length of each leg of the triangle as  's'. Since the altitude to the hypotenuse bisects the hypotenuse, we now have two smaller congruent right triangles with legs of length 's/2' and '6'.\n\nStep 3:\nApplying the Pythagorean theorem to one of these smaller triangles, we get: (s/2)^2 + 6^2 = s^2\n\nStep 4:\nExpanding the equation we get: s^2/4 + 36 = s^2\n\nStep 5:\nCombining like terms we get: 3/4 * s^2 = 36\n\nStep 6:\nSolving for 's^2' gives us: s^2 = 48\n\nStep 7:\nThe area of the triangle is: (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * s * s = (1/2) * s^2 = (1/2) * 48 = 24\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{24}\n```"
