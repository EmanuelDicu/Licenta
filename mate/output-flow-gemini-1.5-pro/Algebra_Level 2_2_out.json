Given that \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65) = \u221a(2\ud835\udc65+1), we substitute  \ud835\udc65=4  to get:\n\ud835\udc54(4) = \u221a(2 * 4 + 1) = \u221a9 = 3.\n\nStep 2: Next, we find  \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc54(4)), which is  \ud835\udc53(3), by substituting  \ud835\udc65=3 into  \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)=\ud835\udc65\u00b2\u22122\ud835\udc65+1:\n\ud835\udc53(3) = 3\u00b2\u22122 * 3 + 1 = 9 - 6 + 1 = 4.\n\nStep 3: Now, we need to find  \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc53(3)), which is  \ud835\udc54(4). We first need to find the value of f(3). \n\ud835\udc53(3) = 3\u00b2\u22122 * 3 + 1 = 9 - 6 + 1 = 4.\nTherefore, g(f(3)) = g(4)\n\nStep 4: We already know from Step 1 that \ud835\udc54(4)=3.\n\nStep 5: Finally, we subtract  \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc53(3)) which is 3 from  \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc54(4))  which is 4: \n\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc54(4))\u2212\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc53(3))= 4 - 3 = 1. \n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{1}\n```"
