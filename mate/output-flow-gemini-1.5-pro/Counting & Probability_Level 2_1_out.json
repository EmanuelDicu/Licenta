(4 factorial) ways to arrange them. \nThis is calculated as 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.\nStep 3:\nHowever, the letter 'T' is repeated twice. \nStep 4:\nWe need to account for the overcounting due to the repetition of the letter 'T'.\nStep 5:\nThe number of ways to arrange the two 'T's within any arrangement of the four letters is 2! (2 factorial), which is 2 * 1 = 2.\nStep 6:\nTo correct for the overcounting, we divide the number of arrangements with unique letters by the number of ways to arrange the repeated letters.\nStep 7:\nTherefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of the letters in the word \"THAT\" is (4!)/(2!) = 24 / 2 = 12.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{12}\n```"
