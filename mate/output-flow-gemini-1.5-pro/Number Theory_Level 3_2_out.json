This means we need to find $n$ such that:\n $$7n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{398}$$\n\nStep 2:\nTo solve this congruence, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. The algorithm allows us to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers and express it as a linear combination of these integers.\n\nStep 3:\nApplying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to 7 and 398, we get:\n\n $$398 = 56 \\cdot 7 + 6$$\n $$7 = 1 \\cdot 6 + 1$$\n $$6 = 6 \\cdot 1 + 0$$\n\nStep 4:\nThe last non-zero remainder is 1, which is the GCD of 7 and 398.  Now, we need to express 1 as a linear combination of 7 and 398.\n\nStep 5:\nWorking backwards from the second to last equation:\n\n $$1 = 7 - 1\\cdot 6$$\n\nStep 6:\nSubstituting the value of 6 from the first equation:\n\n $$1 = 7 - 1 \\cdot (398 - 56 \\cdot 7)$$\n\nStep 7:\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n $$1 = 57 \\cdot 7 - 1 \\cdot 398$$\n\nStep 8:\nTherefore, $57 \\cdot 7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{398}$.\n\nStep 9:\nSo, $n = \\boxed{57}$ is the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 398.\n```"
