Let the two digits be $a_1$ and $a_0$, where $a_1$ is the most significant digit and $a_0$ is the least significant digit. \n\nStep 2:\nThe place values in base b are powers of b:  ..., $b^2$, $b^1$, $b^0$.  Since we're using two digits, the representation of 47 in base b will be of the form: $a_1b^1 + a_0b^0 = a_1b + a_0$.\n\nStep 3:\nWe are given that this representation must equal 47: $a_1b + a_0 = 47$.\n\nStep 4: \nTo find the smallest possible value for b, we want to maximize the value of $a_1$ since it is multiplied by b. The largest possible value for a digit in any base is one less than the base itself.  Therefore, the largest possible value for $a_1$ is $b-1$.\n\nStep 5:\nSubstituting  $a_1 = b-1$ into the equation from Step 3, we get: $(b-1)b + a_0 = 47$.\n\nStep 6:\nSimplifying the equation, we get: $b^2 - b + a_0 = 47$.\n\nStep 7: \nTo minimize b, we should maximize $a_0$. The largest possible value for $a_0$ is also $b-1$. Substituting, we get: $b^2 - b + (b - 1) = 47$.\n\nStep 8:\nSimplifying the equation, we get: $b^2 = 48$.\n\nStep 9: \nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $b = \\sqrt{48}$. Since we are looking for the smallest **whole number** b, we need to find the smallest whole number greater than $\\sqrt{48}$. This number is $\\boxed{7}$. \n```"
