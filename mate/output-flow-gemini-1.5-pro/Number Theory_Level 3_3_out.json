        "correct_solution": "For 47 to be expressed in two digits in base $b$, $47 < 100_b = 1 \\cdot b^2$.  So $\\! \\sqrt{47} < b$, which means the smallest whole number $b$ can be is $\\boxed{7}$.  We can check to be sure: $47 = 65_7 = 115_6$.",

If b = 7, then the largest two-digit number we can form is 66 (base 7), which is equal to 48 in decimal.  This is too large.\n\nStep 5:\nIf b = 6, then the largest two-digit number we can form is 55 (base 6), which is equal to 35 in decimal.  This is too small.\n\nStep 6:\nTherefore, the smallest possible value for 'b' is 8.  We can check that 47 (decimal) is equal to 57 (base 8).\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{8}\n```"
