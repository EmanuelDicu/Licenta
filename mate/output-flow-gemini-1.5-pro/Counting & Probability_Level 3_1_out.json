            "gemini-1.5-pro": "```\nSolution:\n```python\nStep 1: \nWe know that for any number n >= 10, n! will have at least two trailing zeros. This is because 10 = 2 * 5, and any factorial from 10! onwards will have at least one 2 and one 5 in its multiplication, resulting in a trailing zero.\n\nStep 2:\nSince 10! and all factorials after it have two trailing zeros, their tens digit will always be 0. \n\nStep 3:\nThis means we only need to consider the tens digit of the sum 7! + 8! + 9!.\n\nStep 4:\nCalculate 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320, and 9! = 362880.\n\nStep 5:\nThe tens digit of the sum is 4 + 3 + 2 = 9.\n\nStep 6:\nTherefore, the tens digit of the sum 7! + 8! + 9! + ... + 2006! is \\boxed{9}. \n```\n```"
