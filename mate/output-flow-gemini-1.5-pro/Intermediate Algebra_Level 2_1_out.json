Substituting, we get 4(x\u00b2 + xy + y\u00b2) = 28.\n\nStep 3: \nDividing both sides by 4, we have x\u00b2 + xy + y\u00b2 = 7.\n\nStep 4:\nWe want to find xy.  Notice that we can obtain an expression containing xy by squaring the equation x - y = 4. \n\nStep 5:\nSquaring both sides of x - y = 4, we get x\u00b2 - 2xy + y\u00b2 = 16.\n\nStep 6:\nSubtracting the equation in Step 3 (x\u00b2 + xy + y\u00b2 = 7) from the equation in Step 5 (x\u00b2 - 2xy + y\u00b2 = 16), we get -3xy = 9.\n\nStep 7:\nDividing both sides by -3, we find xy = -3.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{-3}\n\"\"\"\n```"
