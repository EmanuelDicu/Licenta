This is equivalent to finding n such that 3n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 11.\nStep 2:\nWe can test the remainders when multiples of 3 are divided by 11:\n* 3 * 1 = 3, which has a remainder of 3 modulo 11.\n* 3 * 2 = 6, which has a remainder of 6 modulo 11.\n* 3 * 3 = 9, which has a remainder of 9 modulo 11.\n* 3 * 4 = 12, which has a remainder of 1 modulo 11.\n* 3 * 5 = 15, which has a remainder of 4 modulo 11.\n* 3 * 6 = 18, which has a remainder of 7 modulo 11.\n* 3 * 7 = 21, which has a remainder of 10 modulo 11.\n* 3 * 8 = 24, which has a remainder of 2 modulo 11.\nStep 3:\nSince 3 * 8 = 24 leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 11, n = 8 is a solution to the congruence. However, we want the residue of n modulo 11, not n itself.\nStep 4:\nTherefore, the residue of n modulo 11 is  8.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{8}\n```"
