This means finding a number $x$ such that $3x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. \nStep 2:\nWe see that $3 \\cdot 4 = 12 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, so the modular inverse of 3 modulo 11 is 4.\nStep 3:\nMultiplying both sides of the congruence $3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$ by 4, we get  \\[12n \\equiv 8 \\pmod{11}.\\]Since $12 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, this reduces to $n \\equiv \\boxed{8} \\pmod{11}$.\n```"
