        "correct_solution": "Instead of adding up scores and figuring out the new averages, a quicker way (useful for the countdown round) is as follows:\n\nSince the average is 90, we first calculate how many points below 90 he already is: he's scored 87, 85, and 87, meaning that he is 3, 5, and 3 points below 90 respectively, making for a total of 11 points below.  We then know that his remaining two tests must be a combined 11 points above 90, and since they differ by 3 points, we know that one test is 4 above 90, and the other is 7 above 90, meaning his highest score was $\\boxed{97}$.",

            "gemini-1.5-pro": "```python\nSolution:\nStep 1:\nEd's average score is 90%, and each test is out of 100 points, so his total score on all five tests is 90/100 * 500 = 450 points.\nStep 2:\nThe total score for his first three tests is 87 + 85 + 87 = 259.\nStep 3:\nTo get a total score of 450, Ed must score 450 - 259 = 191 points on his last two tests.\nStep 4:\nLet's denote his lower score on the last two tests as x. His higher score is then x + 3.\nStep 5:\nThe sum of his last two scores is x + (x + 3) = 191.\nStep 6:\nSimplifying the equation, we get 2x + 3 = 191.\nStep 7:\nSolving for x, we find x = (191 - 3) / 2 = 94.\nStep 8:\nHis highest score on the last two tests is x + 3 = 94 + 3 = 97.\nStep 9:\nComparing this to his first three scores, 97 is the highest overall.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{97}\n```"
