        "correct_solution": "Recall that for positive integers $a$ and $b$ $x^a x^b = x^{a+b}$.  Thus, if $h(x)$, $f(x)$, and $g(x)$ are polynomials such that $h(x)=f(x) \\cdot g(x)$ and if $ x^a $ and $ x^b $ are the highest degree terms of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ then the highest degree term of $h(x)$ will be $x^{a+b}$.  In our case $f(x) = x^2-7x+10$, the highest degree term is $x^2$ and $h(x)$ has highest degree term $x^5$.  Thus, solving for $b$ in the equation $x^5 = x^2 x^b = x^{2+b}$, we find $b=\\boxed{3}$.",

Therefore, the degree of $h(x)$ is the sum of the degree of $( x^2 - 7x + 10 )$ and the degree of $g(x)$.\nStep 5:\nIt follows that $2 + b = 5$.\nStep 6:\nSolving for $b$, we get $b = 3$.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{3}\n```"
