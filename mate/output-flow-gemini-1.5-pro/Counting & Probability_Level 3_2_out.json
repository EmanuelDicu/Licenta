        "problem": "There are 30 men and 40 women in the Town Library Club.  They wish to form a 7-person steering committee with 3 men and 4 women.  In how many ways can they form the committee?",
        "correct_solution": "In this problem, we're really selecting two separate committees.  We can choose 3 men from the 30 men total in $$ \\binom{30}{3} = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 4,\\!060 $$ways, and 4 women from the 40 women total in $$ \\binom{40}{4} = \\frac{40 \\times 39 \\times 38 \\times 37}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 91,\\!390 $$ways.  Since these two selections are independent (since for each of the $4,\\!060$ ways to pick the men, there are $91,\\!390$ ways to pick the women), we multiply them together to get the number of ways that we can form the 7-member overall committee: $$ \\binom{30}{3}\\binom{40}{4} = (4,\\!060)(91,\\!390) = \\boxed{371,\\!043,\\!400}. $$",

            "gemini-1.5-pro": "```\nSolution:\nStep 1: We need to choose 3 men out of 30, which can be done in  \u00b3\u2070C\u2083 ways (30 choose 3), calculated as 30!/(3!\u22c527!) = 4060. This is because we are selecting a group of 3 men out of 30, and the order in which we choose them doesn't matter. \nStep 2: We need to choose 4 women out of 40, which can be done in \u2074\u2070C\u2084 ways (40 choose 4), calculated as 40!/(4!\u22c536!) = 91390. This is because we are selecting a group of 4 women out of 40, and the order doesn't matter.\nStep 3: To get the total number of ways to form the committee, we multiply the number of ways to choose the men by the number of ways to choose the women. \nStep 4: Therefore, the total number of ways to form the committee is \u2074\u2070C\u2084 \u22c5 \u00b3\u2070C\u2083 = 91390 * 4060 = 370,903,400.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{370{,}903{,}400} \n```"
