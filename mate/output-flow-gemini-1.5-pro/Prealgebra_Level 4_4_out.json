            "gemini-1.5-pro": "```\nSolution:\nStep 1: We know the area of a circle is calculated using the formula:  area = \u03c0 * radius\u00b2.\nStep 2:  The ring's area is the difference between the area of the larger circle and the area of the smaller circle: \u03c0 * 13\u00b2 - \u03c0 * 12\u00b2.\nStep 3: Let the radius of the smallest circle be represented by 'r'. Therefore, the area of the smallest circle is \u03c0 * r\u00b2.\nStep 4: We are told that the area of the ring equals the area of the smallest circle. So we can set up the equation: \u03c0 * 13\u00b2 - \u03c0 * 12\u00b2 = \u03c0 * r\u00b2.\nStep 5: Simplify the equation: 169\u03c0 - 144\u03c0 = \u03c0r\u00b2.\nStep 6: Further simplification: 25\u03c0 = \u03c0r\u00b2.\nStep 7: Divide both sides of the equation by \u03c0: 25 = r\u00b2.\nStep 8: Take the square root of both sides to solve for r: \u221a25 = r.\nStep 9: Therefore, the radius of the smallest circle is 5.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{5}\n```"
