        "correct_solution": "Notice that $(a+1)(a-5) = a^2 - 4a - 5$, so $a^2 - 4a + 1 = (a+1)(a-5) + 6$.\n\nAlso, we know that by the Euclidean algorithm, the greatest common divisor of $a+1$ and $a-5$ divides $6$: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(a+1, a-5) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(a+1-(a-5),a-5)\\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(6,a-5).\n\\end{align*}As $10508$ is even but not divisible by $3$, for the sum of the digits of $10508$ is $1 + 5 + 8 = 14$, it follows that the greatest common divisor of $a+1$ and $a-5$ must be $2$.\n\nFrom the identity $xy = \\text{lcm}\\,(x,y) \\cdot \\text{gcd}\\,(x,y)$ (consider the exponents of the prime numbers in the prime factorization of $x$ and $y$), it follows that \\begin{align*}\n(a+1)(a-5) &= \\text{lcm}\\,(a+1,a-5) \\cdot \\text{gcd}\\,(a+1, a-5) \\\\\n&= 2 \\cdot 10508.\n\\end{align*}Thus, the desired answer is $2 \\cdot 10508 + 6 = \\boxed{21022}.$\n\nWith a bit more work, we can find that $a = 147$.",

This means that among the prime factors of 10508, there must be two that differ by 6 so that one can divide $a+1$ and the other can divide $a-5$. \n\nStep 3:\nThe only pair of prime factors of 10508 that differ by 6 are 29 and 2 * 13 = 26. \n\nStep 4:\nWe can have either $a+1=29$ and $a-5=2\\cdot13$ or vice versa. The first case gives us $a=28$, while the second case gives us $a = 31$.\n\nStep 5:\nWe check both possible values of $a$. If $a=28$, then $\\text{lcm}(a+1,a-5)=\\text{lcm}(29,23)=667$, which is not 10508. If $a=31$, then $\\text{lcm}(a+1,a-5) = \\text{lcm}(32,26) = 10508$.\n\nStep 6:\nTherefore, $a = 31$, and $a^2-4a+1 = 31^2-4\\cdot31+1 = \\boxed{842}$. \n```"
