Then $(a+1)(a-5) = 10508$, so we must factor 10508 into two factors that differ by 6. However, this is not possible.\nStep 9:\n**Case 2:** $\\text{gcd}(a+1,a-5) = 2$. Then $(a+1)(a-5) = 2\\cdot10508 = 21016$. We must factor 21016 into two factors that differ by 6. Again, this is not possible.\nStep 10:\n**Case 3:** $\\text{gcd}(a+1,a-5) = 6$. Then $(a+1)(a-5) = 6\\cdot 10508 = 63048$. We must factor 63048 into two factors that differ by 6. We find that $63048 = 212 \\cdot 298$, and $298 - 212 = 6$.\nStep 11:\nSince $a + 1 > a - 5$, we have  $a + 1 = 298$ and $a - 5 = 212$. Solving, we find $a = 297$.\nStep 12:\nTherefore, $a^2 - 4a + 1 = 297^2 - 4\\cdot 297 + 1 = \\boxed{87025}$. \n```"
