Therefore, we know that by the property of corresponding angles, that the angle adjacent to x is congruent to the angle formed by AB and the horizontal segment through A.\nStep 2:\nWe are also given that $AB = BC$, meaning that triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle.\nStep 3:\nBecause triangle ABC is isosceles, we know that angle ABC is congruent to angle ACB.\nStep 4:\nSince the angles in a triangle add up to $180^{\\circ}$, and the angle adjacent to x is $124^{\\circ}$, we have: $x + angle ABC + angle ACB = 180^{\\circ}$\nStep 5:\nCombining the information from steps 3 and 4, we get: $x + angle ABC + angle ABC = 180^{\\circ}$, which can be simplified to: $x + 2 * angle ABC = 180^{\\circ}$.\nStep 6:\nBecause angle ABC and the $124^{\\circ}$ angle are supplementary, we know that:  $angle ABC + 124^{\\circ} = 180^{\\circ}$, so $angle ABC = 56^{\\circ}$\nStep 7:\nSubstituting the value of angle ABC we just calculated into the equation from Step 5, we get: $x + 2 * 56^{\\circ} = 180^{\\circ}$\nStep 8:\nSimplifying the equation from Step 7, we have: $x + 112^{\\circ} = 180^{\\circ}$.\nStep 9:\nSolving for x, we get: $x = 180^{\\circ} - 112^{\\circ} = 68^{\\circ}$\nFinal answer:\n$\\boxed{68^{\\circ}}$\n```"
