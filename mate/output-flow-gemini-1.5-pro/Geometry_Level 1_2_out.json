This is because they are same-side interior angles formed by a transversal intersecting two parallel lines.\nStep 2:\nKnowing that the sum of supplementary angles is $180^{\\circ}$, and that the angle adjacent to $x$ is $124^{\\circ}$, we can calculate $\\angle ABC = 180^{\\circ} - 124^{\\circ} = 56^{\\circ}$.\nStep 3:\nWe are given that $AB = BC$, which means that triangle $ABC$ is an isosceles triangle.\nStep 4:\nBy the definition of an isosceles triangle, the base angles of  $\\triangle ABC$ are congruent, therefore $\\angle BAC = \\angle ABC = 56^{\\circ}$.\nStep 5:\nFinally, knowing that the sum of the angles in any triangle is $180^{\\circ}$, we can write the equation: $x + 56^{\\circ} + 56^{\\circ} = 180^{\\circ}$.\nStep 6:\nSolving the equation for x, we get: $x = 180^{\\circ} - 56^{\\circ} - 56^{\\circ} = 68^{\\circ}$. \nFinal answer:\n$\\boxed{68^\\circ}$\n```"
