So, we have $ab = 1440$.\n\nStep 3:\nThe second term of the given sequence is 1716, which is the product of the second terms of the two arithmetic sequences. So, we have $(a + d)(b + e) = 1716$.\n\nStep 4:\nThe third term of the given sequence is 1848, which is the product of the third terms of the two arithmetic sequences. So, we have $(a + 2d)(b + 2e) = 1848$.\n\nStep 5:\nExpanding the equation in Step 3, we get $ab + ae + bd + de = 1716$. Since we know $ab = 1440$, we can substitute to get $1440 + ae + bd + de = 1716$, which simplifies to $ae + bd + de = 276$.\n\nStep 6:\nExpanding the equation in Step 4, we get $ab + 2ae + 2bd + 4de = 1848$. Substituting $ab = 1440$ gives us $1440 + 2ae + 2bd + 4de = 1848$, which simplifies to $2ae + 2bd + 4de = 408$.\n\nStep 7:\nWe now have two equations with three unknowns: \n$ae + bd + de = 276$\n$2ae + 2bd + 4de = 408$\n\nMultiplying the first equation by -2, we get:\n$-2ae - 2bd - 2de = -552$\n\nAdding this equation to the second equation above, we get:\n$2de = -144$\n\nStep 8:\nSolving for $de$, we find $de = -72$.\n\nStep 9:\nTo find the eighth term of the given sequence, we need to find $(a + 7d)(b + 7e)$. \n\nStep 10:\nWe can use the given information to find the values of $a$, $b$, $d$, and $e$.  Notice that the difference between the first and second terms of the given sequence is $1716 - 1440 = 276$, and the difference between the second and third terms is $1848 - 1716 = 132$.  This suggests that the common difference of the first arithmetic sequence is $132/276 = 1/2$ times the common difference of the second arithmetic sequence.\n\nLet's assume that the common difference of the first arithmetic sequence is $d$ and the common difference of the second arithmetic sequence is $2d$.  Then we have the following equations:\n\n$b(a + d) = 1716$\n$(b + 2d)(a + 2d) = 1848$\n\nExpanding the first equation, we get $ab + bd = 1716$.  Since $ab = 1440$, we have $bd = 276$.\n\nExpanding the second equation, we get $ab + 2ad + 2bd + 4d^2 = 1848$.  Substituting $ab = 1440$ and $bd = 276$, we get $1440 + 2ad + 552 + 4d^2 = 1848$, which simplifies to $2ad + 4d^2 = -144$.  Dividing both sides by 2, we get $ad + 2d^2 = -72$.\n\nWe can factor the left-hand side of this equation to get $d(a + 2d) = -72$.  Since $bd = 276$ and $d = b/2$, we have $b(a + 2d) = 552$.  Therefore, $d(a + 2d)$ is a factor of 552.\n\nThe factors of 552 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 46, 92, 138, 184, 276, and 552.  We can check each of these factors to see if it divides $-72$.  We find that $d = -6$ is a solution.\n\nSubstituting $d = -6$ into the equation $bd = 276$, we get $b = -46$.  Substituting $d = -6$ and $b = -46$ into the equation $ab = 1440$, we get $a = -24$.\n\nStep 11:\nTherefore, the eighth term of the sequence is $(-24 + 7(-6))(-46 + 7(2(-6))) = (-66)(-130) = \\boxed{8580}$.\n```"
