This is allowed by the distributive property of multiplication. \nStep 2:\nThe expression inside the parentheses is a difference of squares, which factors as $(a+b)(a-b)$.\nStep 3:\nApplying the difference of squares pattern, we get $4(9-x^2) = 4(3+x)(3-x)$.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{4(3+x)(3-x)} \n```"
