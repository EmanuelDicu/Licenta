        "correct_solution": "For there to be infinite solutions, the first equation needs to be consistent with the second and yet add no new information, which means it must be a multiple of the second. Since the coefficient of $y$ in the first equation is twice that of $y$ in the second equation, the multiplier is 2. This implies that the first equation must be $2(5x+y)=2(-3)$. After equating coefficients, this gives $2a=2\\cdot5$ and $b=2\\cdot-3$, or $(a,b)=\\boxed{(5,-6)}$.",
