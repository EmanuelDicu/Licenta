This implies that 31 has a multiplicative inverse modulo 2293.\nStep 5:\nTo find the inverse, we work backwards through the Euclidean Algorithm. From the equation 2293 = 74 * 31 + 1, we can express 1 as a linear combination of 31 and 2293:\n1 = 2293 - 74 * 31 \nStep 6:\nTherefore, the inverse of 31 modulo 2293 is -74. However, we want an integer n such that 0 \u2264 n < 2293.\nStep 7: \nTo get a positive value, we add 2293 to -74:\n-74 + 2293 = 2219\nStep 8:\nThus, the multiplicative inverse of 31 modulo 2293 is 2219.\nStep 9:\nTo solve the congruence 31n \u2261 3 (mod 2293), we multiply both sides by the inverse of 31 modulo 2293:\n2219 * 31n  \u2261 2219 * 3 (mod 2293)\nStep 10:\nSimplifying both sides:\nn \u2261 6657 (mod 2293)\nStep 11: \nTo get an integer n within the range 0 \u2264 n < 2293, we take the remainder when 6657 is divided by 2293:\n6657 = 2 * 2293 + 2071\nTherefore, n = 2071.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{2071}\n```"
