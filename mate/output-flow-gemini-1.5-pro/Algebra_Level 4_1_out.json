Let's represent this expression with a variable: \n $$y = \\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{x + ...}}}$$\n\nStep 2: Substitute the expression for  'y' back into the original equation: \n $$y = 5$$\n\nStep 3: Since 'y' represents the entire infinite nested radical, we can substitute 'y' into the inner part of the expression: \n $$y = \\sqrt{x + y}$$\n\nStep 4: Now we have a simple equation. Substitute the value of 'y' from Step 2:\n $$5 = \\sqrt{x + 5}$$\n\nStep 5: Solve for 'x':\nSquare both sides:  $$25 = x + 5$$\nSubtract 5 from both sides: $$x = 20$$\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{x = 20}\n```"
