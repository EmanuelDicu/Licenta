This means that 50 - 8 = 42 students played either hockey, baseball, or both.\n\nStep 2:\nWe know that 33 students played hockey and 24 students played baseball, for a total of 33 + 24 = 57.\n\nStep 3:\nSince 57 is greater than 42, the number of students who played either hockey, baseball, or both, this indicates that some students are counted twice because they play both sports.  The difference between these two numbers represents the number of students who play both sports. Therefore, 57 - 42 = 15 students played both hockey and baseball.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{15}\n\"\"\"\n```"
