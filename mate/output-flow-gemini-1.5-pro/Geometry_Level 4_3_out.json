These two points lie on a diagonal of the square. To find the side length, we need to calculate the distance between these two points. \n\nStep 2:\nUsing the distance formula, the side length of the square is  \u221a((2 - (-2))^2 + (-2 - 2)^2) = \u221a(4^2 + (-4)^2) = \u221a32 = 4\u221a2.\n\nStep 3:\nThe area of a square is calculated by squaring the side length.\n\nStep 4: \nTherefore, the area of the square is (4\u221a2)^2 = 32 square units.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{32}\n```"
