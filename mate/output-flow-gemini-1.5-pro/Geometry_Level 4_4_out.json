Therefore, $AM=MB=\\frac{1}{2}AB = 4$.\n\nStep 2: We are also given that  $\\\\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle with right angle at $C$. We can apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find the lengths of the legs of the triangle.\n\nStep 3: Since $AC$ and $BC$ are the legs of the right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$) to find the length of the hypotenuse, which is $AB$. \n\nStep 4: We are given $AC = 17$ and $BC = 15$. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem: $AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 = 17^2 + 15^2 = 289 + 225 = 514$. Therefore, $AB = \\sqrt{514}$.\n\nStep 5: Now, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem again to find $CM$.  Triangle $AMC$ is also a right triangle (since $\\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle), with right angle at $A$.\n\nStep 6:  We know $AM = 4$ and $AC = 17$. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:  $CM^2 = AC^2 - AM^2 = 17^2 - 4^2 = 289 - 16 = 273$. Therefore, $CM = \\sqrt{273} = \\boxed{3\\sqrt{31}}$.\n```"
