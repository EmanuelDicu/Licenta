Each time she comes to an intersection, she again randomly selects one of the possible directions. What is the probability that, in her first four steps, she will walk completely around the gray square? Express your answer as a common fraction.

        "correct_solution": "The only way for the Dora to end up at her starting point in four steps is for her to traverse the four sides of the gray square.  She can do this in two ways: clockwise and counterclockwise. The probability of each of these two paths is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^4=\\frac{1}{256}$.  Therefore, the probability that she ends up where she started is $\\dfrac{1}{256}+\\dfrac{1}{256}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{128}}$.",

            "gemini-1.5-pro": "```\nSolution:\nStep 1:\nDora starts at point A and needs to move to an adjacent vertex of the gray square. There are two possible directions for this initial step, out of the four possible directions. Therefore, the probability of reaching an adjacent vertex of the gray square in the first step is 2/4 = 1/2.\n\nStep 2:\nNow, Dora is at a vertex of the gray square. To continue walking around the square, she must move in the direction along the side of the square. There is only one favorable direction for this step (out of two possible directions). So, the probability of this step is 1/2.\n\nStep 3:\nSimilarly, for the third and fourth steps, Dora must continue moving along the sides of the gray square, and there's only one favorable direction for each of these steps. Therefore, the probability of each of these steps is also 1/2.\n\nStep 4:\nTo find the overall probability of Dora walking around the gray square in four steps, we need to multiply the probabilities of each individual step. This gives us (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16. \n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}\n```"
