        "correct_solution": "Note that for $n\\geq 2$, the last two digits of $5^n$ are 25.  To prove this, note that $5^2\\equiv 25 \\pmod{100}$, and whenever $5^{n-1}\\equiv 25\\pmod{100}$, we also have $5^n=5\\cdot 5^{n-1}\\equiv 5\\cdot 25 \\equiv 125 \\equiv 25 \\pmod{100}$. Thus the tens digit of $5^{2005}$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
