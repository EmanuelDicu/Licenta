        "correct_solution": "The constant term of the product of two polynomials is just the product of the two constant terms. Therefore we know that $6=-2a$, so $a=-3$. We now consider the linear term of the product of our polynomials. It's given by $-16t=(5t\\cdot-2)+a\\cdot bt\\Longrightarrow-16t=-10t+(-3)bt\\Longrightarrow b=2$. Therefore our answer is $a+b=\\boxed{-1}$.",

Matching the coefficients of the corresponding terms, we get the following system of equations:\n\n*  $3b + 20 = 26$\n*  $4a + 5b - 6 = -8$\n*  $ab - 10 = -16$\n*  $-2a = 6$\n\nStep 4: From the equation $-2a = 6$, we find that $a = -3$.\n\nStep 5: Substituting  $a=-3$ into the equation  $4a + 5b - 6 = -8$, we get $-12+5b-6=-8$ and thus $b=2$.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, $a + b = -3 + 2 = -1$.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{-1}\n```"
