        "correct_solution": "When an image is translated to the right we just add the number of units it is being translated to the original $x$-coordinate. When an image is translated down we just subtract that number of units from the $y$-coordinate. In this case we'll subtract 2 from the $y$-coordinates and add 3 to the   $x$-coordinates. This will make point $B(6, 5)$ move to $B'(6 + 3, 5 - 2) = \\boxed{(9, 3)}$.",

A translation down means we subtract 2 from the y-coordinate. \n\nStep 3: So, the new y-coordinate is 5 - 2 = 3.\n\nStep 4: The parallelogram is also translated 3 units to the right. A translation to the right means we add 3 to the x-coordinate.\n\nStep 5: So, the new x-coordinate is 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the final coordinates of point B after the translations are (9, 3).\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{(9, 3)}\n```"
