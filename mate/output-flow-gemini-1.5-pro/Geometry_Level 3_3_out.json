Solving for $x$ and $y$, we find $x = 16$ and $y = 24$.  Hence, the perimeter of one of the five congruent rectangles is $2x + 2y = \\boxed{80}$.",

Using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, we have: 2(3l) + 2(2w) = 176.\n\nStep 5: Simplifying the equation: 6l + 4w = 176.\n\nStep 6: Dividing the entire equation by 2: 3l + 2w = 88.\n\nStep 7: The perimeter of one of the smaller rectangles is given by 2l + 2w. \n\nStep 8:  We need to solve for 2l + 2w. Notice that we can isolate 2l + 2w in the equation from Step 6:  2l + 2w = 88 - l\n\nStep 9:  We need to find the value of 'l'.  We can use the fact that the length of the larger rectangle (3l) is equal to three times the width of a smaller rectangle (3w): 3l = 3w.  Dividing both sides by 3, we get l = w.\n\nStep 10: Substitute l = w in the equation from Step 6: 3w + 2w = 88.  This simplifies to 5w = 88.\n\nStep 11: Solving for 'w', we get w = 17.6.\n\nStep 12: Since l = w, then l = 17.6.\n\nStep 13: Substitute the values of 'l' and 'w' back into the equation for the perimeter of a smaller rectangle: 2(17.6) + 2(17.6) = 35.2 + 35.2 = 70.4\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{70.4}\n```"
