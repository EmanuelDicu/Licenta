Solving for $x$ and $y$, we find $x = 16$ and $y = 24$.  Hence, the perimeter of one of the five congruent rectangles is $2x + 2y = \\boxed{80}$.",

The width of the larger rectangle is equal to five times the width of a smaller rectangle, so it is '5w'.\n\nStep 3:\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2 * (length + width). We know the perimeter of the larger rectangle is 176, so we can write the equation: 2 * (3l + 5w) = 176.\n\nStep 4:\nSimplifying the equation from Step 3, we get: 6l + 10w = 176.\n\nStep 5:\nDividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get: 3l + 5w = 88.\n\nStep 6:\nLooking at the diagram, we can see that the length of the larger rectangle ('3l') is equal to the width of five smaller rectangles ('5w'). Therefore, we can write the equation: 3l = 5w.\n\nStep 7:\nSolving for 'l', we get: l = (5/3)w.\n\nStep 8:\nSubstituting 'l' in the equation from Step 5 with (5/3)w, we get: 3 * (5/3)w + 5w = 88.\n\nStep 9:\nSimplifying the equation from Step 8, we get: 5w + 5w = 88.\n\nStep 10:\nCombining like terms, we get: 10w = 88.\n\nStep 11:\nSolving for 'w', we get: w = 8.8.\n\nStep 12:\nNow that we know the width of a smaller rectangle ('w' = 8.8), we can find the length ('l') using the equation from Step 7: l = (5/3) * 8.8 = 14.67.\n\nStep 13:\nNow that we know both the length ('l' = 14.67) and width ('w' = 8.8) of a smaller rectangle, we can calculate its perimeter: 2 * (14.67 + 8.8) = 2 * 23.47 = 46.94.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{46.94}\n```"
