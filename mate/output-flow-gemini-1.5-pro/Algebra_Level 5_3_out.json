        "problem": "Billy shoots an arrow from 10 feet above the ground. The height of this arrow can be expressed by the equation $h=10-23t-10t^2$, where $t$ is time in seconds since the arrow was shot. If the center of a target is raised 5 feet off the ground, in how many seconds must the arrow reach the target in order for Billy to hit the bulls eye?",
        "correct_solution": "Since the center of the target is 5 feet above the ground, $h=5$. So we get the quadratic: \\begin{align*}5& =10-23t-10t^{2}\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 0& =10t^{2}+23t-5\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 0&=(2t+5)(5t-1).\n\\end{align*}Thus, the values of $t$ that satisfy the equation are $-\\frac52$ and $\\frac15$. However, since time can never be a negative number, the answer must be $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{5}}$.",

So, we can set $h$ to 5 in the equation:\n$5 = 10-23t-10t^2$\nStep 3:\nTo solve for $t$, lets rearrange the equation to get a quadratic equation:\n$10t^2 + 23t + 5 = 0$\nStep 4:\nWe can use the quadratic formula to solve for $t$:\n$t = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a$\nWhere $a = 10$, $b = 23$, and $c = 5$.\nStep 5:\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n$t = (-23 \u00b1 \u221a(23^2 - 4 * 10 * 5)) / (2 * 10)$\n$t = (-23 \u00b1 \u221a(529 - 200)) / 20$\n$t = (-23 \u00b1 \u221a329) / 20$\nStep 6:\nThis gives us two possible solutions:\n$t1 = (-23 + \u221a329) / 20$ seconds\n$t2 = (-23 - \u221a329) / 20$ seconds\nStep 7:\nBecause time cannot be negative, we discard the second solution. \nStep 8:\nTherefore, it takes the arrow $(-23 + \u221a329) / 20$ seconds to reach a height of 5 feet.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{(-23 + \u221a329) / 20}\n```"
