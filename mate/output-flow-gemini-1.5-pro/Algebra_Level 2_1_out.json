Let's use the second equation:\n```\n3(1) + y = 2\n```\nStep 6: Simplify and solve for *y*:\n```\n3 + y = 2\ny = -1\n```\nStep 7: Now that we know *x = 1* and *y = -1*, substitute these values into the expression 24*x* - 14*y*:\n```\n24(1) - 14(-1)\n```\nStep 8: Simplify the expression to get the final answer:\n```\n24 + 14 = 38\n```\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{38}\n```"
