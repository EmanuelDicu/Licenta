For this we need to calculate the length of the segment PR.\nDistance PR = \u221a((11 - 7)\u00b2 + (3 - 12)\u00b2 + (9 - 10)\u00b2) = \u221a(16 + 81 + 1) = \u221a98 = 7\u221a2.\nWe see that PQ=PR.\nStep 5: Now we need to calculate the vector PQ = (8-7, 8-12, 1-10) = (1, -4, -9) and vector PR = (11-7, 3-12, 9-10) = (4, -9, -1).\nStep 6: Now we need to calculate the dot product of vectors PQ and PR.\nPQ * PR = 1*4 + (-4)*(-9) + (-9)*(-1) = 4 + 36 + 9 = 49.\nStep 7: Now we need to calculate the product of lengths of vectors PQ and PR.\n|PQ|*|PR| = 7\u221a2 * 7\u221a2 = 98.\nStep 8: Since the dot product of vectors PQ and PR is not equal to the product of lengths of vectors PQ and PR, then the angle between these vectors is not equal to 90 degrees, and points P, Q and R do not form a cube.\nTherefore, there is no cube with vertices P=(7,12,10), Q=(8,8,1), and R=(11,3,9).\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{\\text{No solution.}}\n```"
