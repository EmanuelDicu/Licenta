Therefore, 110 fallops are equivalent to 30 ballops.\nStep 4:\nWe also know that 6 wallops are equivalent to 5 ballops.\nStep 5:\nTo find out how many wallops are equivalent to 30 ballops, we can set up another proportion: 6 wallops / 5 ballops = y wallops / 30 ballops.\nStep 6:\nSolving for y, we get y = (30 ballops * 6 wallops) / 5 ballops = 36 wallops. Therefore, 30 ballops are equivalent to 36 wallops.\nStep 7:\nTherefore, 110 fallops are equivalent to 36 wallops.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{36}\n```"
