To find out how many ballops are equivalent to 110 fallops, we can set up a proportion: \n3 ballops / 11 fallops = x ballops / 110 fallops\nStep 2:\nTo solve for x, which represents the number of ballops equivalent to 110 fallops, we can cross-multiply:\n3 ballops * 110 fallops = 11 fallops * x ballops\nStep 3:\nSimplifying both sides of the equation:\n330 = 11x\nStep 4:\nTo isolate x, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:\n330 / 11 = 11x / 11\nStep 5:\nThis gives us:\nx = 30 ballops\nStep 6:\nNow we know that 110 fallops are equivalent to 30 ballops. We also know from the problem that 6 wallops are equivalent to 5 ballops. We can set up another proportion to find out how many wallops are equivalent to 30 ballops:\n6 wallops / 5 ballops = y wallops / 30 ballops, where y represents the number of wallops equivalent to 30 ballops.\nStep 7:\nCross-multiplying to solve for y:\n6 wallops * 30 ballops = 5 ballops * y wallops\nStep 8:\nSimplifying:\n180 = 5y\nStep 9:\nTo isolate y, divide both sides of the equation by 5:\n180 / 5 = 5y / 5\nStep 10:\nThis gives us:\ny = 36 wallops\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{36} \n```"
