This means we need to use combinations.\nStep 2:\nThe formula for combinations is nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes the factorial (e.g., 5! = 5*4*3*2*1).\nStep 3:\nIn our case, we have n = 8 (total people) and r = 3 (committee size).\nStep 4:\nPlugging the values into the formula: 8C3 = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!).\nStep 5:\nCalculating the factorials: 8! = 40320, 3! = 6, 5! = 120.\nStep 6:\nSubstituting the factorials back into the formula: 8C3 = 40320 / (6 * 120).\nStep 7:\nSimplifying the expression: 8C3 = 40320 / 720 = 56.\nTherefore, there are 56 ways to choose a 3-person committee from a group of 8 people.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{56}\n```"
