However, this counts each committee multiple times.\nStep 5:\nFor example, picking person 1 then person 3 then person 2 gives us the same committee as picking person 3 then person 2 then person 1.\nStep 6:\nThe number of different orderings of a 3 person committee is 3! = 3*2*1 = 6.\nStep 7:\nTherefore, the number of ways to choose a committee of 3 from 8 people is (8*7*6)/(3*2*1) = 56.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{56}\n```"
