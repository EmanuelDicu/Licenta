        "correct_solution": "A number will be divisible by 11 if you get a multiple of 11 by alternately adding and then subtracting its digits.  If we name the blank integer $A$, then the alternating sum is $2 - 0 + A - 7 = A -5$.  This value can only be equal to 0 (as 11, 22, etc all yield $A$ that are too large), so $A = \\boxed{5}$ is the only digit that will work.",

            "gemini-1.5-pro": "```\nSolution:\n```python\nStep 1: Recall the divisibility rule for 11. A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits at odd places and the sum of its digits at even places is either 0 or a multiple of 11.\nStep 2: Apply the divisibility rule to the number 20_7. \n     - The sum of digits at odd places is 2 + _.\n     - The sum of digits at even places is 0 + 7 = 7.\n     - The difference between the two sums is (2 + _) - 7 = _ - 5.\nStep 3: Determine the value of the blank that makes the difference divisible by 11. \n    - To make _ - 5 a multiple of 11, the blank must be 5 more than a multiple of 11. \n    - Since the blank represents a single digit, the only possible multiple of 11 that works is 0. \n    - Therefore,  _ = 0 + 5 = 5.\nStep 4: Verify the answer. The number 2057 has a difference between the sum of digits at odd and even places of (2+5)-(0+7) = 7-7 = 0, which is a multiple of 11.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{5} \n```\n```"
