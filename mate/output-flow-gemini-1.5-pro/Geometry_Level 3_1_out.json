            "gemini-1.5-pro": "```python\nSolution:\nStep 1:\nThe diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube. This is because the sphere is inscribed in the cube, meaning it touches all six faces of the cube from the inside. \nStep 2: \nThe volume of a sphere is given by (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where r is the radius of the sphere. We are given that the volume of the sphere is \u03c0/6. So, we can set up the equation: (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 = \u03c0/6.\nStep 3:\nSolving for r\u00b3, we get: r\u00b3 = (\u03c0/6) * (3/4\u03c0) = 1/8.\nStep 4:\nTaking the cube root of both sides, we find that r = 1/2.\nStep 5: \nSince the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube, the side length of the cube is 2r = 1 inch.\nStep 6:\nThe volume of a cube is given by s\u00b3, where s is the side length. Therefore, the volume of the cube is 1\u00b3 = 1 cubic inch.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{1}\n```"
