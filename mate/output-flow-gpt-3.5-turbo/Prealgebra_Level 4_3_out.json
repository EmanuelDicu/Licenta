This gives 6/5 wallops per ballop.\nStep 4:\nCombine the relationships found in Step 2 and Step 3 to calculate how many wallops are equivalent to 1 fallop. Multiply the wallops per ballop by the ballops per fallop: (6/5 * 3/11) = 18/55 wallops per fallop.\nStep 5:\nTo find how many wallops are equivalent to 110 fallops, multiply the wallops per fallop found in Step 4 by 110 fallops: (18/55 * 110) = 36 wallops.\nStep 6:\nTherefore, 110 fallops are equivalent to 36 wallops.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{36}"
