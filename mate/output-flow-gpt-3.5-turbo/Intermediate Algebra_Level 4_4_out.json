        "correct_solution": "By the Integer Root Theorem, any integer root must be a factor of 42.  The prime factorization of 42 is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7.$  Furthermore, the product of the roots is $(-1)^n \\cdot \\frac{42}{a_0},$ where $n$ is the degree of the polynomial, and $a_0$ is the leading coefficient.\n\nTo maximize the number of integer roots, which must be distinct, we can take the integer roots to be 2, 3, 7, 1, and $-1.$  This gives us a maximum of $\\boxed{5}$ integer roots.",
