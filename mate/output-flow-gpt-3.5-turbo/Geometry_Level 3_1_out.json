Therefore, the radius of the sphere is half the side length of the cube.\nStep 4:\nLet the side length of the cube be x. The radius of the inscribed sphere is $\\frac{x}{2}$.\nStep 5:\nSubstitute the radius into the volume formula of the sphere: $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (\\frac{x}{2})^3 = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$.\nStep 6:\nSolve for x in the equation: $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (\\frac{x}{2})^3 = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$.\nStep 7:\nSimplify the equation: $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\cdot \\frac{x^3}{8} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$.\nStep 8:\nMultiply both sides by 24 to eliminate fractions: $32\\pi \\cdot x^3 = 4\\pi$.\nStep 9:\nDivide by $32\\pi$ on both sides: $x^3 = \\frac{4\\pi}{32\\pi} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\nStep 10:\nTake the cube root of both sides: $x = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{8}} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 11:\nThe volume of the cube is $x^3 = (\\frac{1}{2})^3 = \\frac{1}{8}$.\nStep 12:\nTherefore, the number of cubic inches in the volume of the cube is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$ cubic inches."
