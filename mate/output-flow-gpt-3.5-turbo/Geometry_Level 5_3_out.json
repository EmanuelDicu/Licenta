The hypotenuse is 4, and one leg is the radius of the large circle (2), the other leg is half the side of the squares (s/2).\nStep 6:\nBy applying the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangle formed in step 5, we get (s/2)^2 + 2^2 = 4^2, simplifying to s^2/4 + 4 = 16.\nStep 7:\nMultiply through by 4 to get s^2 + 16 = 64.\nStep 8:\nSubtract 16 from both sides to get s^2 = 48.\nStep 9:\nTake the square root of both sides to find s = sqrt(48).\nStep 10:\nSince the area of a square is side squared, the area of the square is (sqrt(48))^2 = 48.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{48}"
