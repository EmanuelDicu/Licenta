Since the pyramid is a right pyramid, segment $\\overline{PF}$ is an altitude of triangle $PBD$.  Since $PBD$ is an equilateral triangle with side length 6, $PFB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle with $FB = BD/2 =3$ and $PF = 3\\sqrt{3}$.  Finally, $\\overline{BD}$ is a diagonal of square base $ABCD$, so we have $BC = BD/\\sqrt{2} = 6/\\sqrt{2} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the volume of the pyramid is \\[\\frac{[ABCD](PF)}{3} = \\frac{(3\\sqrt{2})^2 (3\\sqrt{3})}{3} = \\boxed{18\\sqrt{3}}.\\]",
