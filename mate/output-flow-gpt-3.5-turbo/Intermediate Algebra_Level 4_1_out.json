This can be seen visually in the graph.\nStep 5:\nThe vertices are located a units above and below the center on the y-axis and b units right and left of the center on the x-axis.\nStep 6:\nTherefore, the sum of the parameters h, k, a, and b is h + k + a + b.\nStep 7:\nAs the distances from the center to the vertices are already given, we have h + k + a + b = 6 - 5 + 4 + 2 = 7.\nStep 8:\nTherefore, the sum of the parameters h, k, a, and b in the given hyperbola equation is \\boxed{7}."
