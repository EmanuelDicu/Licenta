Therefore, there are 9 possible choices for the first digit.\n\nStep 3:\nThe remaining 8 digits can each be any digit from 0 to 9. Therefore, there are 10 possible choices for each of the remaining 8 digits.\n\nStep 4:\nTo find the total number of possible 9-digit zip codes, we multiply the number of choices for each digit together: \n9 (for the first digit) * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 (for the remaining 8 digits).\n\nStep 5:\nCalculating the total, we have:\n9 * 10^8.\n\nStep 6:\nTherefore, the total number of possible 9-digit zip codes is:\n\\boxed{900000000}\n```"
