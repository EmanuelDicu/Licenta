Each square must have all four vertices lying on these dots.\n\nStep 2:\nWe need to analyze squares of various sizes. The smallest square has side length 1, the next has side length \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), then side length 2, and so on, up to the maximum possible square inscribed in the grid.\n\nStep 3:\nCount the number of 1 by 1 squares:\n- Each square of side length 1 can be defined by choosing any 4 adjacent dots in a 1x1 arrangement.\n- There are 4 internal rows and columns, so we have \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) such squares.\n\nStep 4:\nCount the number of 2 by 2 squares:\n- Each square of side length 2 is defined by choosing any 4 dots in a 2x2 arrangement.\n- We can place a square in each 3x3 subgrid of our 5x5 grid, i.e., \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) such squares.\n\nStep 5:\nCount the number of 3 by 3 squares:\n- Each square of side length 3 is defined by choosing any 4 dots in a 3x3 arrangement.\n- We can place a square in each 2x2 subgrid of our 5x5 grid, i.e., \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) such squares.\n\nStep 6:\nCount the number of 4 by 4 squares:\n- Each square of side length 4 is defined by choosing any 4 dots in a 4x4 arrangement.\n- We can place a square in 1x1 central subgrid of our 5x5 grid, i.e., \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\) such squares.\n\nStep 7:\nSum all the counted squares:\n- Adding up all the different sizes: \\(16\\) (1 by 1) + \\(9\\) (2 by 2) + \\(4\\) (3 by 3) + \\(1\\) (4 by 4).\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{30}\n```"
