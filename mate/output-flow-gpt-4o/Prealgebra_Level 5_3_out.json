        "problem": "In Mathopolis, an adult is a person 21 years of age or older and a child is a person under 21 years of age.  Exactly half of the  adults in Mathopolis are female, and exactly half of the female  adults have exactly one biological child.  Nobody else has a  child, and there are no other children.  What percent of the  people of Mathopolis are children?",
        "correct_solution": "Let the percentage of people in Mathopolis who are children be $x$. The percentage of adults is then $1-x$. Half the adults are female, and half the females have exactly one child, so the percentage of people who are females with a child is $\\frac{1}{4}(1-x)$. This percentage is equal to the percentage of children, since there is a correspondence between a mother and a child. So we have the equation $x=\\frac{1}{4}(1-x)$. Solving for $x$ yields $x=1/5$, or $\\boxed{20}$ percent.",

Therefore, the number of children is given by \\(\\frac{\\frac{A}{2}}{2} = \\frac{A}{4}\\).\n\nStep 4:\nNow, the total population of Mathopolis is the number of adults plus the number of children, which is \\( A + \\frac{A}{4} \\).\n\nStep 5:\nTo find the percentage of the population that are children, we divide the number of children by the total population and then multiply by 100:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage of children} = \\left(\\frac{\\frac{A}{4}}{A + \\frac{A}{4}} \\times 100\\right)\n\\]\n\nStep 6:\nFirst, simplify the denominator:\n\\[\nA + \\frac{A}{4} = \\frac{4A}{4} + \\frac{A}{4} = \\frac{5A}{4}\n\\]\n\nStep 7:\nNow, substitute the simplified denominator into the percentage formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage of children} = \\left(\\frac{\\frac{A}{4}}{\\frac{5A}{4}} \\times 100\\right) = \\left(\\frac{A}{4} \\div \\frac{5A}{4} \\times 100\\right) = \\left(\\frac{A}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{5A} \\times 100\\right)\n\\]\n\nStep 8:\nFurther simplify the fraction:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage of children} = \\left(\\frac{A \\times 4}{4 \\times 5A} \\times 100\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{5} \\times 100\\right) = 20\n\\]\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{20}\n```"
