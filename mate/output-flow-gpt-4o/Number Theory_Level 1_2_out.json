        "correct_solution": "A number will be divisible by 11 if you get a multiple of 11 by alternately adding and then subtracting its digits.  If we name the blank integer $A$, then the alternating sum is $2 - 0 + A - 7 = A -5$.  This value can only be equal to 0 (as 11, 22, etc all yield $A$ that are too large), so $A = \\boxed{5}$ is the only digit that will work.",

The numbers in the odd positions are the 1st and 3rd digits, and the numbers in the even positions are the 2nd and 4th digits.\n\nStep 4:\nIdentify the known digits: the first digit is 2, the second digit is 0, and the fourth digit is 7. Let \\( x \\) be the digit we need to find that fills the blank (the third digit).\n\nStep 5:\nApply the rule for divisibility by 11:\nSum of digits in the odd positions: \\( 2 + x \\)\nSum of digits in the even positions: \\( 0 + 7 = 7 \\)\n\nStep 6:\nFor the number to be a multiple of 11, the difference between the sum of the odd-position digits and the sum of the even-position digits must be a multiple of 11:\n\\[ (2 + x) - 7 = k \\times 11 \\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\nStep 7:\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[ 2 + x - 7 = k \\times 11 \\]\n\\[ x - 5 = k \\times 11 \\]\n\nStep 8:\nSince \\( x \\) must be a single digit (0 through 9), we look for an integer value of \\( k \\) that makes \\( x \\) within this range:\n\\[ x = k \\times 11 + 5 \\]\n\nStep 9:\nFor \\( x \\) to be a valid single digit, \\( k \\) must result in \\( x \\) being between 0 and 9. Evaluate possible \\( k \\) values:\n\\[ k = 0: \\quad x = 0 \\times 11 + 5 = 5 \\]\n\nStep 10:\nSince \\( k = 0 \\) gives \\( x = 5 \\), this is the only digit that satisfies the condition.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{5}\n```"
