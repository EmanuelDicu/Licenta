The results of the survey were:\n\n$\\bullet$ $33$ students played hockey\n\n$\\bullet$ $24$ students played baseball\n\n$\\bullet$ $8$ students played neither hockey nor baseball\n\nHow many of the students surveyed played both hockey and baseball?",
        "correct_solution": "Since there were $50$ students surveyed in total and $8$ played neither hockey nor baseball, then $42$ students in total played one game or the other.\n\nSince $33$ students played hockey and $24$ students played baseball, and this totals $33+24=57$ students, then there must be $\\boxed{15}$ students who are \"double-counted\", that is who play both sports.",

According to the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the total number of students who played either hockey or baseball or both can be found by summing the number of students who played hockey and the number of students who played baseball, and then subtracting the number of students who played both:\n33 + 24 - x = 42.\nStep 5:\nSolving for x, we get:\n57 - x = 42.\nStep 6:\nSubtracting 42 from both sides, we have:\n57 - 42 = x.\nStep 7:\nTherefore, x = 15.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{15}\n```"
