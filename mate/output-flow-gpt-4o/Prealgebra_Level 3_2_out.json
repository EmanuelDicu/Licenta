We need to choose 3 distinct roles: President, Vice-President, and Treasurer.\n\nStep 2:\nTo choose a President, we have 8 possibilities since no one has been chosen yet.\n\nStep 3:\nAfter selecting the President, we now have 7 remaining candidates for the Vice-President role.\n\nStep 4:\nAfter selecting both the President and the Vice-President, we have 6 remaining candidates for the Treasurer role.\n\nStep 5:\nThe total number of ways to choose the three roles is the product of the number of choices for each role. Therefore, the total number of ways is:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ (choices for President)} \\times 7 \\text{ (choices for Vice-President)} \\times 6 \\text{ (choices for Treasurer)} \\]\n\nStep 6:\nCalculate the product:\n\\[ 8 \\times 7 = 56 \\]\n\\[ 56 \\times 6 = 336 \\]\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{336}\n```"
