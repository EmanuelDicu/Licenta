        "problem": "Hillary has eleven coins, all dimes and nickels. In total, the coins are worth 75 cents. How many nickels does she have?",
        "correct_solution": "Let the number of dimes Hillary has be $d$ and the number of nickels she has be $n$. We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\nd+n&=11\\\\\n10d+5n&=75\n\\end{align*} (The last equation is in terms of cents.) To make the second equation nicer, we divide both sides by 5 to get $2d+n=15$. From the first given equation, we have $d=11-n$. Substituting this into the simplified second given equation to eliminate $d$, we get $2(11-n)+n=15\\Rightarrow n=7$. Thus, Hillary has $\\boxed{7}$ nickels.",

            "gpt-4o": "```\nStep 1:\nLet x be the number of nickels Hillary has.\nStep 2:\nSince Hillary has a total of eleven coins and the rest are dimes, we express the number of dimes as 11 - x.\nStep 3:\nNickels are worth 5 cents each, so the value of the nickels in cents is 5x.\nStep 4:\nDimes are worth 10 cents each, so the value of the dimes in cents is 10(11 - x).\nStep 5:\nThe total value of all coins is given as 75 cents, so we set up the equation: \n5x + 10(11 - x) = 75\nStep 6:\nDistribute the 10 inside the parenthesis:\n5x + 110 - 10x = 75\nStep 7:\nCombine like terms:\n-5x + 110 = 75\nStep 8:\nSubtract 110 from both sides:\n-5x = 75 - 110\nStep 9:\nSimplify the right side:\n-5x = -35\nStep 10:\nDivide both sides by -5 to solve for x:\nx = 7\nStep 11:\nTherefore, the number of nickels Hillary has is 7.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{7}\n```"
