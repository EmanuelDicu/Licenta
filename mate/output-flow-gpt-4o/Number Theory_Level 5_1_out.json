        "correct_solution": "Any factor of $3^6\\cdot5^{10}$ is in the form $3^a\\cdot5^b$ for $0\\le a\\le6$ and $0\\le b\\le{10}$. To count the number of perfect cube factors, we must count the factors of $3^6\\cdot5^{10}$ that have $a=0$, $3$, or $6$ and $b=0$, $3$, $6$, or $9$. This gives $3\\cdot4=\\boxed{12}$ perfect cube factors.",

Given \\(3^6\\), \\(a\\) can be 0, 3, or 6 (three options).\nFor the prime factor \\(5^b\\), \\(b\\) must be a multiple of 3. Given \\(5^{10}\\), \\(b\\) can be 0, 3, 6, or 9 (four options).\n\nStep 4:\nCalculate the total number of such factors by multiplying the number of options for each prime factor.\nThere are 3 choices for the exponent of 3 (0, 3, or 6).\nThere are 4 choices for the exponent of 5 (0, 3, 6, or 9).\nSo, the total number of positive perfect cube factors is \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\).\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{12}\n```"
