        "correct_solution": "By the Integer Root Theorem, any integer root must be a factor of 42.  The prime factorization of 42 is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7.$  Furthermore, the product of the roots is $(-1)^n \\cdot \\frac{42}{a_0},$ where $n$ is the degree of the polynomial, and $a_0$ is the leading coefficient.\n\nTo maximize the number of integer roots, which must be distinct, we can take the integer roots to be 2, 3, 7, 1, and $-1.$  This gives us a maximum of $\\boxed{5}$ integer roots.",

This means that if the polynomial has integer roots, the product of these roots will be 42.\n\nStep 2:\nWe need to list all distinct integer factors of 42 to identify the possible integer roots. These factors are: \\( \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 6, \\pm 7, \\pm 14, \\pm 21, \\pm 42 \\).\n\nStep 3:\nTo maximize the number of distinct integer roots, we should select the largest number of factors such that their product is 42. The appropriate distinct factors are: \\( -1, -1, 2, 3, 7 \\).\n\nStep 4:\nCheck the product of these roots:\n\\[ (-1) \\times (-1) \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 42 \\]\n\nStep 5:\nSince the product equals the constant term 42 and all roots are distinct, the polynomial can have these 5 integer roots.\n\nStep 6:\nTherefore, the largest possible number of integer roots for the polynomial is 5.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{5}\n```"
