        "correct_solution": "When an image is translated to the right we just add the number of units it is being translated to the original $x$-coordinate. When an image is translated down we just subtract that number of units from the $y$-coordinate. In this case we'll subtract 2 from the $y$-coordinates and add 3 to the   $x$-coordinates. This will make point $B(6, 5)$ move to $B'(6 + 3, 5 - 2) = \\boxed{(9, 3)}$.",

Therefore, we subtract 2 from the y-coordinate of point $B$. \nNew y-coordinate of point $B$ becomes $5 - 2 = 3$.\n\nStep 3:\nThe parallelogram is translated right 3 units. Therefore, we add 3 to the x-coordinate of point $B$.\nNew x-coordinate of point $B$ becomes $6 + 3 = 9$.\n\nStep 4:\nTherefore, the new coordinates of point $B$ after the translation are $(9, 3)$.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{(9, 3)}"
