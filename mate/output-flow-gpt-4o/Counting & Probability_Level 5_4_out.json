        "correct_solution": "The best way to do this is to find the probability that the two E's are next to each other.  There are $\\dfrac{7!}{2}$ arrangements of the word SIXTEEN.  If we want to find the number of arrangements such that the E's are next to each other, we find the number of arrangements of the six-letter word SIXT(EE)N (where we treat the two E's as a block), which is $6!$.  So the probability that an arrangement of the word SIXTEEN has the two E's next to each other is $\\dfrac{6!}{\\frac{7!}{2}} = \\dfrac{2}{7}$.  So the probability that the two E's aren't next to each other is $1 - \\dfrac{2}{7} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{7}}$.",

We need to calculate the total number of ways to arrange these 7 letters. \nTo do this, we use the formula for permutations of multiset:\n\\[ \\frac{n!}{k_1! \\cdot k_2! \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot k_m!} \\]\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of letters, \\( k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_m \\) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.\n\nStep 3:\nHere, \\( n = 7 \\) (total letters), and \\( k_1 = 2 \\) (for E), and all other letters appear once. \nSo, the total number of ways to arrange the letters is:\n\\[ \\frac{7!}{2!} = \\frac{5040}{2} = 2520 \\]\n\nStep 4:\nNext, we calculate the number of ways where the two E's are adjacent. \nWe treat the adjacent E's as a single unit, thus reducing the problem to arranging 6 \"letters\": {EE, S, I, X, T, N}.\n\nStep 5:\nThe number of ways to arrange these 6 units is:\n\\[ 6! = 720 \\]\n\nStep 6:\nThe probability that the two E's are adjacent is the ratio of the number of favorable arrangements (where the E's are together) to the total number of arrangements:\n\\[ \\frac{720}{2520} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nStep 7:\nWe then need the probability that the two E's are not adjacent. \nThis is the complement of the probability that they are adjacent:\n\\[ 1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}\n```"
