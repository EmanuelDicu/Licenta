        "correct_solution": "Instead of adding up scores and figuring out the new averages, a quicker way (useful for the countdown round) is as follows:\n\nSince the average is 90, we first calculate how many points below 90 he already is: he's scored 87, 85, and 87, meaning that he is 3, 5, and 3 points below 90 respectively, making for a total of 11 points below.  We then know that his remaining two tests must be a combined 11 points above 90, and since they differ by 3 points, we know that one test is 4 above 90, and the other is 7 above 90, meaning his highest score was $\\boxed{97}$.",

Let the scores of the last two tests be \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nStep 2:\nEd scores 87, 85, and 87 points on the first three tests. So, the sum of the first three tests is:\n\\[ 87 + 85 + 87 = 259 \\]\n\nStep 3:\nThe scores of Ed's last two tests differ by three points. This can be written as:\n\\[ x - y = 3 \\]\n\nStep 4:\nEd has a 90% average on his five tests. To find the total score needed for a 90% average over five tests:\n\\[ 0.9 \\times 500 = 450 \\]\nSo, the sum of all five test scores must be 450 points.\n\nStep 5:\nSince the sum of the first three test scores is 259, the sum of the scores for the last two tests is:\n\\[ 450 - 259 = 191 \\]\n\nStep 6:\nWe have two equations now:\n\\[ x + y = 191 \\]\n\\[ x - y = 3 \\]\n\nStep 7:\nSolve the system of equations. Add the equations \\( x + y = 191 \\) and \\( x - y = 3 \\):\n\\[ (x + y) + (x - y) = 191 + 3 \\]\n\\[ 2x = 194 \\]\n\\[ x = 97 \\]\n\nStep 8:\nSubstitute \\( x = 97 \\) back into the equation \\( x + y = 191 \\):\n\\[ 97 + y = 191 \\]\n\\[ y = 94 \\]\n\nStep 9:\nTherefore, Ed's scores for the last two tests are 97 and 94. The highest score among these is:\n\\[ \\boxed{97} \\]\n```"
