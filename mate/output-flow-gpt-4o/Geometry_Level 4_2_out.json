Since $\\triangle AMB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle and $AB=6$, $AM=3\\sqrt{3}$. Since $AO$ is $2/3$ of $AM$, we have $AO=2\\sqrt{3}$. Thus, the area of the circle is $\\pi(2\\sqrt{3})^2=\\boxed{12\\pi}$.",

            "gpt-4o": "```\nSolution:\nStep 1:\nThe given problem involves an equilateral triangle with side lengths of 6 units, circumscribed by a circle. We need to find the area of the circle.\n\nStep 2:\nFirst, calculate the height (h) of the equilateral triangle using the Pythagorean theorem. By splitting the triangle into two right triangles, each side of the right triangle will have lengths: 3 units (half of the base) and a hypotenuse of 6 units.\nUsing the formula \\( h = \\sqrt{s^2 - \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^2} \\):\n\\[\nh = \\sqrt{6^2 - 3^2}\n\\]\n\\[\nh = \\sqrt{36 - 9} = \\sqrt{27} = 3\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nStep 3:\nThe centroid of the equilateral triangle divides its height in a 2:1 ratio. The radius (R) of the circumscribed circle is twice the length from the centroid to a vertex:\n\\[\n\\text{Centroid to vertex} = \\frac{2}{3}h\n\\]\n\\[\nR = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 3\\sqrt{3} = 2\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nStep 4:\nThe area of the circle is given by the formula \\( A = \\pi R^2 \\):\n\\[\nA = \\pi (2\\sqrt{3})^2\n\\]\n\\[\nA = \\pi (4 \\times 3) = 12\\pi\n\\]\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{12\\pi}\n```"
