Use the relationship 3 ballops = 11 fallops.\nStep 5:\nCalculate the number of ballops: (110 fallops) * (3 ballops / 11 fallops) = 30 ballops.\nStep 6:\nNext, find the number of wallops equivalent to 30 ballops using the relationship 6 wallops = 5 ballops.\nStep 7:\nCalculate the number of wallops: (30 ballops) * (6 wallops / 5 ballops) = 36 wallops.\nStep 8:\nTherefore, the number of wallops equivalent to 110 fallops is \\boxed{36}."
