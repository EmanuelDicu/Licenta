This means $d_1$ must be less than $b$ and $d_0$ must be less than $b$.\nStep 5:\nTo have only two digits, $d_1$ must be a positive integer and $d_0$ must be an integer such that $0 \\leq d_0 < b$.\nStep 6:\nWe're looking for the smallest $b$ such that $d_1b + d_0 = 47$ where $d_1 < b$.\nStep 7:\nWe start testing from the smallest possible value of $b$ until the criteria are satisfied.\nStep 8:\nFor $b = 7$, we calculate $d_1$ and $d_0$:\n$d_1 = \\lfloor 47 / 7 \\rfloor = 6$\n$d_0 = 47 - 6 \\times 7 = 5$\nThe number 47 in base 7 is written as $65_7$, which uses two digits.\nStep 9:\nVerify whether $b=6$ works:\n$d_1 = \\lfloor 47 / 6 \\rfloor = 7$\nBut $7$ is not less than $6$, thus $b=6$ is not valid.\nStep 10:\nThe smallest whole number $b$ where 47 can be written using only two digits is 7.\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{7}\n```"
