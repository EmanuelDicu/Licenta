        "problem": "Liz has 11 marbles of different colors. In how many ways can she choose 3 of the marbles, if she refuses to choose the green one and the purple one at the same time?",
        "correct_solution": "We can divide this into cases:\n\nCase 1: Liz chooses the green marble, and not the purple marble. In this case, Liz must choose 2 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles (since she won't choose the purple marble). So, there are $\\binom{9}{2}=36$ choices in this case.\n\nCase 2: Liz chooses the purple marble, and not the green marble. As in Case 1, Liz must choose 2 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles. So, there are $\\binom{9}{2}$ choices in this case.\n\nCase 3: Liz chooses neither the green marble nor the purple marble. In this case, Liz must choose three marbles from the nine remaining marbles, and there are $\\binom{9}{3}=84$ choices in this case.\n\nThe total number of possible choices is $36+36+84=\\boxed{156}$.\n\nAlternatively, there are $\\binom{11}{3}=165$ ways to select three marbles. Of those, $\\binom{9}{1}=9$ ways contain both the purple marble and the green marble. Therefore, there are $165-9=\\boxed{156}$ ways to select three marbles such that purple and green marbles are not both chosen.",

            "gpt-4o": "```\nStep 1:\nThe total number of marbles Liz has is 11.\n\nStep 2:\nWe need to choose 3 marbles out of these 11. The total number of ways to choose 3 marbles from 11 is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{r} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of items, and \\( r \\) is the number of items to choose. So, we have \\( \\binom{11}{3} \\).\n\nStep 3:\nCalculate \\( \\binom{11}{3} \\):\n\\[\n\\binom{11}{3} = \\frac{11!}{3!(11-3)!} = \\frac{11!}{3! \\cdot 8!} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 165\n\\]\nThere are 165 ways to choose any 3 marbles from 11.\n\nStep 4:\nNow we need to account for the constraint that Liz refuses to choose the green marble and the purple marble at the same time. We'll first calculate the number of ways to choose 3 marbles that include both the green and purple marbles.\n\nStep 5:\nIf Liz chooses both the green and the purple marbles, she only needs to choose 1 more marble from the remaining 9 marbles (since two are already chosen). The number of ways to choose 1 marble from the remaining 9 is \\( \\binom{9}{1} \\).\n\nStep 6:\nCalculate \\( \\binom{9}{1} \\):\n\\[\n\\binom{9}{1} = 9\n\\]\nThere are 9 ways to choose the remaining marble when green and purple are already chosen.\n\nStep 7:\nSubtract the 9 unwanted combinations (which include both green and purple) from the total number of combinations:\n\\[\n165 - 9 = 156\n\\]\n\nFinal answer:\n\\boxed{156}\n```"
