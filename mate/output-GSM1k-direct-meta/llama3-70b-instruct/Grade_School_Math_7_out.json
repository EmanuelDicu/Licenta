            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them step by step.\n\n**Part 1: Calculate the points earned so far**\n\nAndy's team has played 26 games, with 15 wins, 5 ties, and 6 losses. Let's calculate the points earned so far:\n\n* 15 wins x 3 points/win = 15 x 3 = 45 points\n* 5 ties x 1 point/tie = 5 x 1 = 5 points\n* 6 losses x 0 points/loss = 6 x 0 = 0 points\n\nTotal points earned so far = 45 + 5 + 0 = 50 points\n\n**Part 2: Determine the remaining games**\n\nAndy's team has played 26 games, but they need to play a total of 38 games. Let's find out how many games are remaining:\n\n38 (total games) - 26 (games played) = 12 games remaining\n\n**Part 3: Calculate the points needed to reach 80**\n\nAndy's team needs 80 points to finish in first place. They have already earned 50 points. Let's find out how many more points they need:\n\n80 (required points) - 50 (points earned) = 30 points needed\n\n**Part 4: Determine if it's possible to reach 80 points**\n\nSince Andy's team has 12 games remaining, they can earn a maximum of:\n\n* 12 wins x 3 points/win = 12 x 3 = 36 points (if they win all remaining games)\n* 12 ties x 1 point/tie = 12 x 1 = 12 points (if they tie all remaining games)\n\nEven if they win all remaining games, they can earn a maximum of 36 points, which is still short of the 30 points needed to reach 80.\n\n**Solution**\n\nAndy's team needs 30 more points to reach 80 points, but they cannot earn enough points in the remaining 12 games to reach their goal."
