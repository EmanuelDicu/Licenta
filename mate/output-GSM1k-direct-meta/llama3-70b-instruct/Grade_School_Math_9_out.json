The bag has 384 jellybeans in it. Unfortunately, many of Ms. Crabapple\u2019s students have a poorly developed work ethic, and only half of them complete all of the required homework.

To find the number of eligible students, we need to divide 32 by 2.\n\n32 \u00f7 2 = 16\n\nSo, there are 16 eligible students.\n\n**Part 2: Identify the total number of jelly beans**\nThe problem states that the bag has 384 jelly beans.\n\n**Part 3: Divide the jelly beans among the eligible students**\nTo find out how many jelly beans each eligible student will receive, we need to divide the total number of jelly beans (384) by the number of eligible students (16).\n\n384 \u00f7 16 = 24\n\nTherefore, each of the 16 eligible students will receive **24 jelly beans**.\n\nThe solution to the problem is that each eligible student will receive 24 jelly beans."
