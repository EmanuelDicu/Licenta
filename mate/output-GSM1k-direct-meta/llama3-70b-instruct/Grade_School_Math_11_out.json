Each section has 2 paragraphs, so the total number of paragraphs in the articles Bob has to read is:\n\n3 articles x 4 sections/article x 2 paragraphs/section = 24 paragraphs\n\nEmily has to read 2 articles, and each article has 4 sections. Each section has 2 paragraphs, so the total number of paragraphs in the articles Emily has to read is:\n\n2 articles x 4 sections/article x 2 paragraphs/section = 16 paragraphs\n\n**Step 4: Find the total number of paragraphs Bob and Emily have to read**\n\nThe total number of paragraphs Bob has to read is:\n\n24 paragraphs (from books) + 24 paragraphs (from articles) = 48 paragraphs\n\nThe total number of paragraphs Emily has to read is:\n\n48 paragraphs (from books) + 16 paragraphs (from articles) = 64 paragraphs\n\n**Step 5: Find the total number of paragraphs Bob and Emily have to read**\n\nThe total number of paragraphs Bob and Emily have to read is:\n\n48 paragraphs (Bob) + 64 paragraphs (Emily) = 112 paragraphs\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is: **Bob and Emily will read a total of 112 paragraphs**."
