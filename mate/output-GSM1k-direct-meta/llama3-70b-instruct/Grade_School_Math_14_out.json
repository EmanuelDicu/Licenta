            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve it in a logical order.\n\n**Part 1: Determine the amount Maryann still needs to save**\n\nMaryann needs to buy a bike that costs $450, and she already has $120 saved up. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost of the bike:\n\n$450 (cost of the bike) - $120 (amount already saved) = $330\n\nSo, Maryann still needs to save $330 to afford the bike.\n\n**Part 2: Determine how much Maryann earns per hour**\n\nMaryann earns $15 per hour at her part-time job. This information will help us find out how many hours she needs to work to earn the remaining amount.\n\n**Part 3: Calculate how many hours Maryann needs to work**\n\nNow, we need to find out how many hours Maryann needs to work to earn the remaining amount of $330. We can do this by dividing the amount she still needs to save ($330) by her hourly wage ($15):\n\n$330 (amount still needed) \u00f7 $15 (hourly wage) = 22 hours\n\nSo, Maryann needs to work 22 hours to earn the remaining amount of $330 and afford the bike.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nMaryann needs to work 22 hours at her part-time job to earn enough money to afford the bike that costs $450."
