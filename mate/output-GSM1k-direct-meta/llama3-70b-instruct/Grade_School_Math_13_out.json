            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them step by step.\n\n**Part 1: Calculate the total number of candies at the start**\n\nFrancis had 20 of each flavor of candy, so there were:\n\n* 20 lemon candies\n* 20 orange candies\n* 20 cherry candies\n\nTotal number of candies at the start = 20 + 20 + 20 = 60 candies\n\n**Part 2: Calculate the number of candies eaten**\n\nFrancis ate:\n\n* 10 lemon candies\n* 4 orange candies\n* 16 cherry candies\n\nTotal number of candies eaten = 10 + 4 + 16 = 30 candies\n\n**Part 3: Calculate the number of candies left**\n\nTotal number of candies left = Total number of candies at the start - Total number of candies eaten\n= 60 - 30\n= 30 candies\n\n**Part 4: Calculate the percentage of candies left for each flavor**\n\nLet's calculate the percentage of candies left for each flavor:\n\n* Lemon candies: 20 - 10 = 10 left. Percentage = (10/20) \u00d7 100% = 50%\n* Orange candies: 20 - 4 = 16 left. Percentage = (16/20) \u00d7 100% = 80%\n* Cherry candies: 20 - 16 = 4 left. Percentage = (4/20) \u00d7 100% = 20%\n\n**Part 5: Calculate the average percentage of candies left**\n\nTo find the average percentage, we add the percentages for each flavor and divide by 3:\n\n(50% + 80% + 20%) / 3 = 150% / 3 = 50%\n\nSo, the average percentage of candies left is 50%.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is:\n\n**Francis has an average of 50% of the candies left.**"
