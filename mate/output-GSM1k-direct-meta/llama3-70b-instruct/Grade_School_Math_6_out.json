            "meta/llama3-70b-instruct": "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve it in a logical order.\n\n**Part 1: Calculate Marge's weekly income**\n\nMarge works 30 hours a week, and her job pays $15/hr. To find her weekly income, we need to multiply the number of hours she works per week by her hourly wage.\n\nWeekly income = Hourly wage x Number of hours worked per week\n= $15/hr x 30 hours/week\n= $450/week\n\nSo, Marge earns $450 per week.\n\n**Part 2: Calculate how many weeks Marge needs to work to buy the car**\n\nMarge wants to buy a car that costs $3600. To find out how many weeks she needs to work to buy the car, we need to divide the cost of the car by her weekly income.\n\nNumber of weeks = Cost of the car \u00f7 Weekly income\n= $3600 \u00f7 $450/week\n= 8 weeks\n\nTherefore, Marge needs to work for 8 weeks to buy the car.\n\n**Solution**\n\nMarge needs to work for 8 weeks to earn enough money to buy the car she wants.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on any part of the solution!"
