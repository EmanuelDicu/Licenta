He\u2019s eaten ten lemon, four orange, and sixteen cherry-flavored candies. If there were twenty of each when he started, how much of an average percentage is still left?",

            "gpt-3.5-turbo": "To solve this problem, we can split it into the following logical parts:\n1. Calculate the total number of candies Francis had initially.\n2. Calculate the total number of candies he has eaten in 3 hours.\n3. Calculate the total number of candies left.\n4. Calculate the percentage of candies left for each flavor.\n5. Calculate the average percentage of candies left in the bowl.\n\nLet's solve each part step by step:\n\n1. Total number of candies Francis had initially:\n   - Lemon candies: 20\n   - Orange candies: 20\n   - Cherry candies: 20\n   Total initial candies = 20 (lemon) + 20 (orange) + 20 (cherry) = 60 candies\n\n2. Total number of candies he has eaten in 3 hours:\n   - Lemon candies eaten: 10\n   - Orange candies eaten: 4\n   - Cherry candies eaten: 16\n   Total candies eaten = 10 (lemon) + 4 (orange) + 16 (cherry) = 30 candies\n\n3. Total number of candies left:\n   Total candies left = Total initial candies - Total candies eaten\n                      = 60 - 30\n                      = 30 candies\n\n4. Calculate the percentage of candies left for each flavor:\n   - Lemon candies left: (20 - 10) / 20 * 100% = 50%\n   - Orange candies left: (20 - 4) / 20 * 100% = 80%\n   - Cherry candies left: (20 - 16) / 20 * 100% = 20%\n\n5. Calculate the average percentage of candies left in the bowl:\n   Average percentage of candies left = (50% + 80% + 20%) / 3\n                                      = 50% + 80% + 20% / 3\n                                      = 50% + 26.67%\n                                      \u2248 56.67%\n\nTherefore, the average percentage of candies left in the bowl is approximately 56.67%."
