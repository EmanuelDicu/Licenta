Amount Maryann already has saved = $120\n3. Remaining amount needed to afford the bike = $450 - $120 = $330\n4. Maryann's hourly earning rate = $15 per hour\n5. Number of hours needed to work to earn $330 = $330 / $15/hour = 22 hours\n\nTherefore, Maryann needs to work 22 hours at her part-time job to earn enough money to afford the bike."
