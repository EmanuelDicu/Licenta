Bob has to read 2 books, and each book has 3 chapters with 4 paragraphs each.\nTotal paragraphs for Bob from books = 2 books x 3 chapters/book x 4 paragraphs/chapter = 24 paragraphs.\n\n2. Bob has to read 3 articles, and each article has 4 sections with 2 paragraphs each.\nTotal paragraphs for Bob from articles = 3 articles x 4 sections/article x 2 paragraphs/section = 24 paragraphs.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total paragraphs Bob will read:\nTotal paragraphs for Bob = Total paragraphs from books + Total paragraphs from articles\nTotal paragraphs for Bob = 24 paragraphs (books) + 24 paragraphs (articles) = 48 paragraphs.\n\nNext, let's calculate for Emily:\n1. Emily has to read 4 books, each book has 3 chapters with 4 paragraphs each.\nTotal paragraphs for Emily from books = 4 books x 3 chapters/book x 4 paragraphs/chapter = 48 paragraphs.\n\n2. Emily has to read 2 articles, and each article has 4 sections with 2 paragraphs each.\nTotal paragraphs for Emily from articles = 2 articles x 4 sections/article x 2 paragraphs/section = 16 paragraphs.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total paragraphs Emily will read:\nTotal paragraphs for Emily = Total paragraphs from books + Total paragraphs from articles\nTotal paragraphs for Emily = 48 paragraphs (books) + 16 paragraphs (articles) = 64 paragraphs.\n\nFinally, let's find the total number of paragraphs Bob and Emily will read:\nTotal paragraphs for Bob and Emily = Total paragraphs for Bob + Total paragraphs for Emily\nTotal paragraphs for Bob and Emily = 48 paragraphs (Bob) + 64 paragraphs (Emily) = 112 paragraphs.\n\nTherefore, Bob and Emily will read a total of 112 paragraphs."
