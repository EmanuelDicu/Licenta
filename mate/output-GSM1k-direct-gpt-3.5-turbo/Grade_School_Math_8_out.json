She has already read 5 books, so the total number of books she needs to read is 25 - 5 = 20 books.\n\n3. **Calculate the average number of books she needs to read each month:**  \nTo win the contest and read all 20 remaining books by the end of May, Molly needs to read 20 books in 5 months.  \nAverage books per month = Total books / Total months  \nAverage books per month = 20 books / 5 months  \nAverage books per month = 4 books  \nSo, she needs to read an average of 4 books per month to win the contest.\n\nTherefore, Molly needs to read an average of 4 books per month to achieve her goal of reading 25 books by the end of May and win the contest."
