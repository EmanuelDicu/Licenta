        "problem": "Sally went to the mall to buy clothes for the summer. She went to Forever 21 and bought 4 tops, each priced at $12.99, $6.99, $17.99, $21.99, and 3 pants each priced at $15.99. If her subtotal is over $75, she gets a discount of 15% on her purchase at that store. Then she goes to Shoe Palace and buys 2 shoes for a total of $123.26. How much money did Sally spend at the mall?",
