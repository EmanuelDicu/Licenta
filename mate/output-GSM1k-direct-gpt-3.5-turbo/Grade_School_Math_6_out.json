Calculate the total amount Marge earns per week:\nMarge earns $15 per hour and works 30 hours per week, so she earns:\n$15/hour * 30 hours/week = $450/week\n\n2. Determine how many weeks it will take Marge to save $3600:\nTo buy the car which costs $3600, Marge needs to work:\n$3600 / $450/week = 8 weeks\n\nTherefore, Marge needs to work 8 weeks to buy her car."
