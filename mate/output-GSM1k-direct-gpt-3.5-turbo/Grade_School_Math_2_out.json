Calculate the number of strings Bernie breaks in a year:\nBecause Bernie breaks an average of 3 guitar strings per week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply 3 strings/week by 52 weeks/year to find the total number of strings he breaks in a year.\n3 strings/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 strings/year\n\n2. Calculate the total cost of replacing these strings:\nEach guitar string costs $3 to replace. To find the total cost of replacing all 156 strings Bernie breaks in a year, we multiply the cost per string by the total number of strings.\n$3/string * 156 strings = $468\n\nTherefore, Bernie spends $468 on guitar strings over the course of an entire year."
