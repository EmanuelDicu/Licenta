            "gemini-1.5-flash": "Here's how to solve the problem, breaking it down into smaller parts:\n\n**1. Understanding the Relationship**\n\n* **Sphere Inscribed in a Cube:** Imagine a sphere fitting perfectly inside a cube. The diameter of the sphere will be equal to the side length of the cube. \n\n**2. Finding the Radius of the Sphere**\n\n* **Volume of a Sphere:** The formula for the volume of a sphere is  V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where r is the radius.\n* **Given Volume:** We know the volume of the sphere is \u03c0/6 cubic inches.\n* **Solving for Radius:**\n    * (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 = \u03c0/6\n    * r\u00b3 = (\u03c0/6) * (3/4\u03c0) = 1/8\n    * r = \u00b3\u221a(1/8) = 1/2 inch\n\n**3. Finding the Side Length of the Cube**\n\n* **Diameter and Side Length:** The diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube. Since the radius is 1/2 inch, the diameter is 1 inch. \n\n**4. Finding the Volume of the Cube**\n\n* **Volume of a Cube:** The formula for the volume of a cube is V = s\u00b3, where s is the side length.\n* **Side Length:** We know the side length (s) of the cube is 1 inch.\n* **Solving for Volume:**\n    * V = 1\u00b3 = 1 cubic inch\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe volume of the cube is **1 cubic inch**. \n"
