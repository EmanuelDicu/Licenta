The formula for the sum (S) is:\n   S = a / (1 - r) \n   where 'a' is the first term and 'r' is the common ratio.\n\n**Solving the Problem**\n\n1. **Identify the given information:**\n   *  Common ratio (r) = -1/2\n   *  Sum (S) = 45\n\n2. **Apply the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:**\n   *  45 = a / (1 - (-1/2))\n\n3. **Simplify the equation:**\n   *  45 = a / (3/2)\n\n4. **Solve for the first term (a):**\n   *  a = 45 * (3/2) \n   *  a = 67.5\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe first term of the infinite geometric series is **67.5**. \n"
