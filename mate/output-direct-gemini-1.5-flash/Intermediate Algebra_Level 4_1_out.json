            "gemini-1.5-flash": "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Identify the Center**\n\n* The standard form of a hyperbola centered at $(h,k)$ is  \\[\\frac{(y - k)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(x - h)^2}{b^2} = 1.\\]\n* The center of the hyperbola is the point where the two dashed lines intersect.  From the graph, we see that the center is $(h,k) = (6,-5)$.\n\n**2. Determine the Values of  *a* and *b***\n\n* **Vertical Hyperbola:** Since the hyperbola opens upwards and downwards, we know it's a vertical hyperbola. This means the term with $(y-k)^2$ is positive in the equation.\n* ***a*:** The distance from the center to a vertex is *a*.  From the graph, we see that the distance from the center $(6,-5)$ to a vertex is 2 units. Therefore, *a* = 2.\n* ***b*:** The distance from the center to a focus is *c*. The distance from the center to a focus is given by the length of the dashed lines, which we see is 4 units.  We know the relationship between *a*, *b*, and *c* for a hyperbola:  \n   *c*\u00b2 = *a*\u00b2 + *b*\u00b2.\n* Substitute the values we know: 4\u00b2 = 2\u00b2 + *b*\u00b2. Solving for *b*, we get *b* = 2\u221a3.\n\n**3. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n* We have *h* = 6, *k* = -5, *a* = 2, and *b* = 2\u221a3.\n* Therefore, *h* + *k* + *a* + *b* = 6 - 5 + 2 + 2\u221a3 = **3 + 2\u221a3**.\n\n**Solution:** The solution to the problem is **3 + 2\u221a3**. \n"
