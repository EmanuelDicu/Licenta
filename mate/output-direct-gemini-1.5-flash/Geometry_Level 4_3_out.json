You'll notice they form a tilted square.\n* **Understanding the Square:** A square has four equal sides and four right angles. We'll use this knowledge to find the area.\n\n**2. Find the Side Length**\n\n* **Choose two adjacent points:** Select any two points that are adjacent (next to each other) on the square, like (-2, 2) and (2, -2).\n* **Use the Distance Formula:** The distance between these two points will be the side length of the square. The distance formula is:\n\n   \u221a[(x\u2082 - x\u2081)\u00b2 + (y\u2082 - y\u2081)\u00b2]\n\n   Let's plug in our points:\n\n   \u221a[(2 - (-2))\u00b2 + (-2 - 2)\u00b2] = \u221a[(4)\u00b2 + (-4)\u00b2] = \u221a(16 + 16) = \u221a32 = 4\u221a2\n\n**3. Calculate the Area**\n\n* **Area of a square:** The area of a square is side length squared (s\u00b2).\n* **Substitute the side length:** Area = (4\u221a2)\u00b2 = 16 * 2 = 32\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe area of the square is **32 square units**. \n"
