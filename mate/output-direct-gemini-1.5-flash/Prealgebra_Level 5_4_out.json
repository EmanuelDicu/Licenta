Find the coordinate of B, the midpoint of PQ.**\n\n* **Understanding Midpoints:** The midpoint of a line segment is the point that lies exactly halfway between the endpoints.  \n* **Formula:** To find the midpoint, we average the coordinates of the endpoints.  In this case, the midpoint B has a coordinate of (8 + 48) / 2 = 28.\n\n**2. Find the coordinate of C, the midpoint of BQ.**\n\n* **Endpoints:**  The endpoints of segment BQ are B (coordinate 28) and Q (coordinate 48).\n* **Midpoint Formula:** The midpoint C has a coordinate of (28 + 48) / 2 = 38.\n\n**3. Find the coordinate of D, the midpoint of PC.**\n\n* **Endpoints:** The endpoints of segment PC are P (coordinate 8) and C (coordinate 38).\n* **Midpoint Formula:** The midpoint D has a coordinate of (8 + 38) / 2 = 23.\n\n**Therefore, the coordinate of D is 23.** \n"
