Understand the Problem**\n\n* We're dealing with three circles, one inside the other (concentric).\n* We know the radii of the two largest circles (12 and 13).\n* The area of the ring between the two largest circles is equal to the area of the smallest circle.\n* We need to find the radius of the smallest circle.\n\n**2. Break Down the Problem**\n\n* **Calculate the area of the ring:**  The area of the ring is the difference between the areas of the two larger circles.\n* **Calculate the area of the smallest circle:**  Since the area of the ring equals the area of the smallest circle, we'll use the calculated area of the ring.\n* **Find the radius of the smallest circle:**  Knowing the area of the smallest circle, we can use the formula for the area of a circle to find its radius.\n\n**3. Solve the Problem**\n\n* **Area of the ring:**\n    * Area of larger circle (radius 13):  \u03c0(13)\u00b2 = 169\u03c0\n    * Area of smaller circle (radius 12): \u03c0(12)\u00b2 = 144\u03c0\n    * Area of the ring: 169\u03c0 - 144\u03c0 = 25\u03c0\n\n* **Area of the smallest circle:**  The area of the smallest circle is also 25\u03c0.\n\n* **Radius of the smallest circle:**\n    * Let 'r' be the radius of the smallest circle.\n    * Area of the smallest circle = \u03c0r\u00b2\n    * 25\u03c0 = \u03c0r\u00b2\n    * 25 = r\u00b2\n    * r = \u221a25 = 5\n\n**4. Solution**\n\nThe radius of the smallest circle is **5**. \n"
