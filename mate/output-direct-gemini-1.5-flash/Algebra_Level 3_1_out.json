Expand both sides of the equation**\n\n* **Left side:**  \n   (2x + 1)(3x + 2) = 6x\u00b2 + 4x + 3x + 2 = 6x\u00b2 + 7x + 2 \n* **Right side:**\n   (x - 3)(6x - 5) = 6x\u00b2 - 5x - 18x + 15 = 6x\u00b2 - 23x + 15\n\n**2. Simplify the equation**\n\nNow our equation looks like this:\n6x\u00b2 + 7x + 2 = 6x\u00b2 - 23x + 15\n\n**3. Combine like terms**\n\nSince both sides have a 6x\u00b2 term, we can subtract it from both sides to eliminate it:\n7x + 2 = -23x + 15\n\n**4. Isolate the x term**\n\nAdd 23x to both sides:\n30x + 2 = 15\n\n**5. Isolate the x term**\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n30x = 13\n\n**6. Solve for x**\n\nDivide both sides by 30:\nx = 13/30\n\n**Therefore, the solution to the problem is x = 13/30.** \n"
