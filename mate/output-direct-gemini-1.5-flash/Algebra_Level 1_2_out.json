        "problem": "Hillary has eleven coins, all dimes and nickels. In total, the coins are worth 75 cents. How many nickels does she have?",
        "correct_solution": "Let the number of dimes Hillary has be $d$ and the number of nickels she has be $n$. We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\nd+n&=11\\\\\n10d+5n&=75\n\\end{align*} (The last equation is in terms of cents.) To make the second equation nicer, we divide both sides by 5 to get $2d+n=15$. From the first given equation, we have $d=11-n$. Substituting this into the simplified second given equation to eliminate $d$, we get $2(11-n)+n=15\\Rightarrow n=7$. Thus, Hillary has $\\boxed{7}$ nickels.",

Define Variables**\n\n* Let 'd' represent the number of dimes.\n* Let 'n' represent the number of nickels.\n\n**2. Set Up Equations**\n\n* **Equation 1 (Total Coins):**  d + n = 11  (Hillary has 11 coins in total)\n* **Equation 2 (Total Value):** 10d + 5n = 75  (The value of dimes + the value of nickels = 75 cents)\n\n**3. Solve for One Variable**\n\n* We can solve Equation 1 for 'd': \n   d = 11 - n\n\n**4. Substitute to Eliminate a Variable**\n\n* Substitute the value of 'd' from step 3 into Equation 2:\n   10(11 - n) + 5n = 75\n\n**5. Simplify and Solve for 'n'**\n\n* Distribute: 110 - 10n + 5n = 75\n* Combine like terms: 110 - 5n = 75\n* Subtract 110 from both sides: -5n = -35\n* Divide both sides by -5: n = 7\n\n**Solution:** Hillary has **7** nickels. \n"
