        "correct_solution": "We want to find the residue $c$ such that $35c \\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}$. Recall that, since 35 is relatively prime to 47, this inverse exists and is unique. To make use of the table we are given, we notice that $35 = 5\\cdot 7$. We can multiply both sides of $35c \\equiv 1\\pmod{47}$ by the inverse of 5 to obtain  \\begin{align*}\n19\\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot c &\\equiv 19\\cdot 1 \\pmod{47} \\implies \\\\\n(19\\cdot 5) \\cdot 7 \\cdot c &\\equiv 19 \\pmod{47} \\implies \\\\\n1 \\cdot 7 \\cdot c &\\equiv 19 \\pmod{47}. \\\\\n\\end{align*}Now we can multiply both sides by 27, the inverse of 7, to find  \\begin{align*}\n27\\cdot 7 \\cdot c &\\equiv 27\\cdot 19 \\pmod{47} \\implies \\\\\nc &\\equiv 513 \\pmod{47}.\n\\end{align*}Subtracting 470 from 513 does not change its residue (mod 47), so we have $c\\equiv 43\\pmod{47}$. Since $0\\leq 43 < 47$, $\\boxed{43}$ is the desired residue.\n\nRemark: More generally, the approach above shows that $(ab)^{-1}=b^{-1}a^{-1}$, where $b^{-1}$ denotes the modular inverse of $b$.",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "## Solving the Modular Inverse of 35 (mod 47)\n\nWe're given a table of modular inverses for residues modulo 47.  We need to find the inverse of 35 (mod 47).  Here's how to break down the problem:\n\n**1. Express 35 as a product of known residues:**\n\n* Notice that 35 can be written as the product of 5 and 7:  35 = 5 * 7.\n* We know the inverses of 5 and 7 from the table:\n    * Inverse of 5 (mod 47) is 19\n    * Inverse of 7 (mod 47) is 27\n\n**2. Utilize the property of modular inverses:**\n\n* A key property of modular inverses is that the inverse of a product is the product of the inverses.\n* This means the inverse of 35 (mod 47) is the product of the inverses of 5 and 7:\n    * Inverse of (5 * 7) (mod 47) = (Inverse of 5) * (Inverse of 7) (mod 47)\n\n**3. Calculate the product of the inverses:**\n\n* Substitute the inverses from the table:\n    * (Inverse of 5) * (Inverse of 7) (mod 47) = 19 * 27 (mod 47)\n* Calculate 19 * 27 = 513.\n* Find the remainder when 513 is divided by 47: 513 = 10 * 47 + 43\n\n**4. The answer:**\n\n* Therefore, the inverse of 35 (mod 47) is **43**. \n"
