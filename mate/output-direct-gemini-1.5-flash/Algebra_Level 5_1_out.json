            "gemini-1.5-flash": "##  Factoring $36-4x^2$\n\nThis problem is a Level 5 difficulty because it involves recognizing a specific factoring pattern. Here's how we can break it down:\n\n**1. Identify the pattern:**\n\n* Notice that both 36 and 4 are perfect squares: $36 = 6^2$ and $4 = 2^2$.\n* We also see that the expression is a difference: $36 - 4x^2$. \n\nThis tells us we have a **difference of squares** pattern.\n\n**2. Recall the difference of squares formula:**\n\n* The difference of squares formula states:  $a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)$\n\n**3. Apply the formula:**\n\n* In our problem,  $a = 6$ and $b = 2x$.\n* Substituting into the formula: \n   $36 - 4x^2 = 6^2 - (2x)^2 = (6 + 2x)(6 - 2x)$\n\n**4. Simplify (optional):**\n\n* We can factor out a 2 from both terms in each factor: \n   $(6 + 2x)(6 - 2x) = 2(3 + x) \\cdot 2(3 - x) = \\boxed{4(3 + x)(3 - x)}$ \n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe completely factored expression is **4(3 + x)(3 - x)**. \n"
