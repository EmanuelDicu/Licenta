Therefore, $f(g(4)) -g(f(3)) = 4-3 = \\boxed{1}$.\n\n\nNotice that $f(g(4)) = 4$ and $g(f(3)) = 3$.  Is that a coincidence?",

Find g(4)**\n\n* We are given that  g(x) = \u221a(2x + 1). \n* Substitute x = 4 into the expression for g(x):\n   g(4) = \u221a(2 * 4 + 1) = \u221a9 = 3\n\n**2. Find f(g(4))**\n\n* We know that g(4) = 3.\n* Now, substitute x = 3 into the expression for f(x):\n   f(3) = 3\u00b2 - 2(3) + 1 = 9 - 6 + 1 = 4\n\n**3. Find f(3)**\n\n* We are given that f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 1.\n* Substitute x = 3 into the expression for f(x):\n   f(3) = 3\u00b2 - 2(3) + 1 = 9 - 6 + 1 = 4\n\n**4.

Calculate f(g(4)) - g(f(3))**\n\n* We have found that f(g(4)) = 4 and g(f(3)) = 3.\n*  Therefore, f(g(4)) - g(f(3)) = 4 - 3 = 1\n\n**Solution:** The value of f(g(4)) - g(f(3)) is **1**. \n"
