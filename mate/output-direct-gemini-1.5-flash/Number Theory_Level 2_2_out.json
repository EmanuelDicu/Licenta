            "gemini-1.5-flash": "Here's how we can solve the problem:\n\n**Part 1: Identify the two-digit multiples of 7**\n\n* We need to find all the two-digit numbers divisible by 7. These numbers range from 14 (2 * 7) to 98 (14 * 7).\n\n**Part 2: Find multiples of 7 with a digit sum of 10**\n\n* We need to find the numbers from the list in Part 1 where the sum of the digits equals 10.  We can do this by checking each number:\n    * 14: 1 + 4 = 5\n    * 21: 2 + 1 = 3\n    * 28: 2 + 8 = 10  (This is one of our numbers)\n    * ...\n    * 77: 7 + 7 = 14\n    * 84: 8 + 4 = 12\n    * 91: 9 + 1 = 10  (This is our second number)\n\n**Part 3: Calculate the sum of the two multiples of 7**\n\n* We found the two multiples of 7 with a digit sum of 10: 28 and 91.\n* The sum of these two numbers is 28 + 91 = 119.\n\n**Solution:** The sum of the two multiples of 7 with a digit sum of 10 is **119**. \n"
