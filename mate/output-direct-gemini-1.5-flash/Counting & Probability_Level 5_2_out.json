            "gemini-1.5-flash": "Let's break down this problem into smaller parts:\n\n**Part 1:  Identify the possible sizes of squares**\n\n* **Smallest:** The smallest square will have sides of length 1 unit, using 2 dots on each side.\n* **Medium:** Squares can have sides of length 2 units, using 3 dots on each side.\n* **Large:** Squares can have sides of length 3 units, using 4 dots on each side.\n* **Largest:** Squares can have sides of length 4 units, using 5 dots on each side.\n\n**Part 2: Count the number of squares for each size**\n\n* **1x1 Squares:**  Each dot can be the bottom-left corner of a 1x1 square.  There are 5 rows and 5 columns, so 5 * 5 = **25** 1x1 squares.\n* **2x2 Squares:** Imagine sliding a 2x2 square across the grid.  The bottom-left corner can be in any of the first 4 rows and 4 columns. So there are 4 * 4 = **16** 2x2 squares.\n* **3x3 Squares:**  Similar to the 2x2 case, the bottom-left corner can be in any of the first 3 rows and 3 columns. So there are 3 * 3 = **9** 3x3 squares.\n* **4x4 Squares:** There is only **1** 4x4 square, using all the dots.\n\n**Part 3: Add the squares of all sizes**\n\nThe total number of squares is 25 + 16 + 9 + 1 = **51**\n\n**Solution:** There are **51** squares with all four vertices on the 5 by 5 rectangular grid of dots. \n"
