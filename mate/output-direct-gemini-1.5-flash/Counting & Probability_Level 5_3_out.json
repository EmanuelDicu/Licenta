        "correct_solution": "We know that the number of subsets of any given set is equal to $2^n,$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the set. First, then, we need to find the number of composite divisors. The prime factorization of $72$ is $72=2^3 \\cdot 3^2,$ so there are $(3+1)(2+1)=12$ total divisors. (To see this, note that we can form a divisor of the form $2^a 3^b$ by freely choosing $a=0,1,2,3$ and $b=0,1,2$). Of these, $1$ is neither prime nor composite, and $2$ and $3$ are prime, for a total of $9$ composite divisors. Therefore there are $2^9=\\boxed{512}$ subsets of the divisors of $72$ with only composite divisors.",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "Here's how we can solve this problem by breaking it down:\n\n**Part 1: Find the divisors of 72**\n\n* **Prime Factorization:**  Begin by finding the prime factorization of 72:  $72 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2$\n* **Divisors:** To find all the divisors, consider the powers of the prime factors:\n    *  The powers of 2 are 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n    *  The powers of 3 are 0, 1, and 2.\n    *  To get a divisor, take one power of 2 and one power of 3 and multiply them.  This gives us the following divisors:\n        * 1  (2\u2070 * 3\u2070)\n        * 2  (2\u00b9 * 3\u2070)\n        * 3  (2\u2070 * 3\u00b9)\n        * 4  (2\u00b2 * 3\u2070)\n        * 6  (2\u00b9 * 3\u00b9)\n        * 8  (2\u00b3 * 3\u2070)\n        * 9  (2\u2070 * 3\u00b2)\n        * 12 (2\u00b2 * 3\u00b9)\n        * 18 (2\u00b9 * 3\u00b2)\n        * 24 (2\u00b3 * 3\u00b9)\n        * 36 (2\u00b2 * 3\u00b2)\n        * 72 (2\u00b3 * 3\u00b2)\n\n**Part 2: Identify the composite divisors**\n\n* **Definition of Composite:** A composite number is a number that has more than two factors (including 1 and itself).\n* **Composite Divisors of 72:** From the list above, the composite divisors of 72 are: 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.\n\n**Part 3: Count the subsets containing only composite numbers**\n\n* **Think about the empty set:** The empty set is considered a subset of any set, and it contains no elements, so it fits our criteria.\n* **Counting the subsets:**  We have 9 composite divisors.  To form a subset, we can choose to include or exclude each of these 9 divisors.  This gives us 2 choices for each divisor: include or exclude.\n* **Total Subsets:**  Since we have 9 divisors, we have a total of 2\u2079 = 512 possible subsets.  However, this includes subsets with prime numbers.\n\n**Part 4:  Subtract subsets containing prime numbers**\n\n* **Prime Divisors:**  The prime divisors of 72 are 2 and 3.\n* **Subsets with Prime Numbers:** We need to subtract the number of subsets that include either 2 or 3 (or both).\n* **Counting Subsets with Prime Numbers:** We can apply the same logic as before:\n    *  For the number 2, we have 2\u2078 = 256 possible subsets (since we have 8 composite divisors left).\n    *  For the number 3, we have 2\u2078 = 256 possible subsets.\n    * **Overlap:** We've counted the subset containing both 2 and 3 twice, so we need to subtract 1.\n\n**Part 5:  Calculate the Final Count**\n\n* **Final Answer:** The number of subsets of the set of divisors of 72 containing only composite numbers is: 512 (total subsets) - 256 (subsets with 2) - 256 (subsets with 3) + 1 (to avoid double-counting the subset {2, 3}) = **1**.\n\n**Therefore, there is only one subset of the set of divisors of 72 that contains only composite numbers (the empty set).** \n"
