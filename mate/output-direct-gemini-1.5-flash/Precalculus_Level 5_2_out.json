            "gemini-1.5-flash": "Here's how we can solve this problem by breaking it down into manageable parts:\n\n**Part 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n* **Key Idea:**  We need to find an angle *x* that makes the cosine of a series of angles (multiples of 2\u03c0x) nonpositive. \n* **Nonpositive:** This means the cosines can be zero or negative.\n* **Smallest Possible Positive Value:**  We are looking for the smallest *x* that satisfies the condition, and *x* must be greater than zero.\n\n**Part 2: Visualizing Cosine**\n\n* Remember the graph of the cosine function.  It oscillates between 1 and -1.\n* A cosine value is zero at the \"peaks\" and \"troughs\" of the graph.\n* A cosine value is negative in the regions between the peaks and troughs.\n\n**Part 3: Finding Patterns with Multiples of 2\u03c0x**\n\n* **Observation:**  Notice that as we increase the angle by multiples of 2\u03c0, we are essentially moving along the cosine graph in multiples of its period. \n* **Example:** \n    * If cos(2\u03c0x) is negative, then cos(4\u03c0x) will also be negative because 4\u03c0x is twice the angle of 2\u03c0x. \n    * However,  cos(8\u03c0x) is not guaranteed to be negative, as 8\u03c0x is twice the angle of 4\u03c0x, and it could potentially land at a peak or trough where the cosine is zero. \n\n**Part 4:  Finding the Solution**\n\n* **Goal:** To make all five cosine values nonpositive, we need to ensure that:\n    * Each cosine value is either zero or negative.\n    * The angle 32\u03c0x  lands in a region where the cosine is negative or zero.\n* **Finding the Angle:**  \n    * The smallest angle where the cosine is zero is \u03c0/2. \n    * Since we need 32\u03c0x to be a multiple of \u03c0/2, we can write:\n        * 32\u03c0x = (n/2)\u03c0, where 'n' is an odd integer.\n    * Solving for x: \n        * x = n/64\n    * The smallest positive value of x is obtained when n = 1:\n        * x = 1/64\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe smallest possible positive value of *x* that satisfies the given conditions is **x = 1/64**. \n"
