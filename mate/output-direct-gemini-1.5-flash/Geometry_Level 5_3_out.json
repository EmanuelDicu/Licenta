Label the center of the large circle as  O and the centers of the smaller circles as A, B, C, and D.  Label a vertex of the square as E.\n\n**2. Focus on a Smaller Shape**\n\n* Consider the right triangle formed by points O, A, and E. This triangle is a key to unlocking the problem.\n\n**3. Use Geometry Relationships**\n\n* **Side Lengths:**  \n    * OA = 2 (radius of the large circle)\n    * AE = 1 + 2 = 3 (radius of a small circle + radius of the large circle)\n\n* **Pythagorean Theorem:**  Since triangle OAE is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:  \n    * OE\u00b2 = OA\u00b2 + AE\u00b2\n    * OE\u00b2 = 2\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 = 13\n\n* **Side of the Square:**  OE is half the diagonal of the square.  The diagonal of the square is 2 * OE = 2\u221a13.  \n\n* **Area of the Square:**  Let s be the side of the square.  We know the diagonal of the square is s\u221a2.  Therefore, \n    * s\u221a2 = 2\u221a13\n    * s = (2\u221a13) / \u221a2 = \u221a26\n\n**4. Calculate the Area**\n\n* The area of the square is s\u00b2 = (\u221a26)\u00b2 = **26**\n\n**Therefore, the area of the square is 26.** \n"
