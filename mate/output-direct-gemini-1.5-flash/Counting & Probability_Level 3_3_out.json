        "problem": "A target consists of four concentric circles with radii 4 inches, 6 inches, 8 inches and 10 inches as shown. Given that a dart is thrown that hits the target at a random point, what is the probability that it hits a shaded region? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]size(100); import graph; fill(Circle((0,0),5),gray(.6));\n\nclip(Circle((0,0),2) ^^ Circle((0,0),3) ^^ Circle((0,0),4),fillrule(1));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),2) ^^ Circle((0,0),3) ^^ Circle((0,0),4) ^^ Circle((0,0),5));[/asy]",
        "correct_solution": "The total area of the target is $\\pi\\cdot 10^2=100\\pi$.  The area of the inner shaded region is the area of a circle with radius 4, and that is equal to $\\pi\\cdot 4^2=16\\pi$.  We can calculate the area of the shaded ring as the difference in areas of a circle with radius 8 and with radius 6.  This gives an area of $\\pi \\cdot 8^2 - \\pi \\cdot 6^2 = 28\\pi$.  The total shaded area is $16\\pi+28\\pi=44\\pi$.  The probability a dart will hit a shaded region is equal to $\\frac{44\\pi}{100\\pi}=\\boxed{\\frac{11}{25}}$.",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe need to find the probability of a dart hitting the shaded region of the target.  This means we need to:\n\n* **Calculate the area of the shaded region.**\n* **Calculate the total area of the target.**\n* **Divide the area of the shaded region by the total area.**\n\n**2. Calculate the Area of the Shaded Region**\n\n* **Area of the largest circle:**  \u03c0(10\u00b2)= 100\u03c0 square inches\n* **Area of the circle with radius 8 inches:** \u03c0(8\u00b2) = 64\u03c0 square inches\n* **Area of the circle with radius 6 inches:** \u03c0(6\u00b2) = 36\u03c0 square inches\n* **Area of the circle with radius 4 inches:** \u03c0(4\u00b2) = 16\u03c0 square inches\n\nThe shaded area is the difference between the areas of the largest circle and the circle with radius 8 inches.  This is 100\u03c0 - 64\u03c0 = 36\u03c0 square inches.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Area of the Target**\n\nThe total area is simply the area of the largest circle: 100\u03c0 square inches.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability**\n\nThe probability of the dart hitting the shaded region is the area of the shaded region divided by the total area:\n\n(36\u03c0 square inches) / (100\u03c0 square inches) = **9/25**\n\n**Therefore, the probability of the dart hitting the shaded region is 9/25.** \n"
