        "correct_solution": "The best way to do this is to find the probability that the two E's are next to each other.  There are $\\dfrac{7!}{2}$ arrangements of the word SIXTEEN.  If we want to find the number of arrangements such that the E's are next to each other, we find the number of arrangements of the six-letter word SIXT(EE)N (where we treat the two E's as a block), which is $6!$.  So the probability that an arrangement of the word SIXTEEN has the two E's next to each other is $\\dfrac{6!}{\\frac{7!}{2}} = \\dfrac{2}{7}$.  So the probability that the two E's aren't next to each other is $1 - \\dfrac{2}{7} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{7}}$.",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "Here's how to solve the problem by breaking it down into smaller parts:\n\n**1. Total Possible Arrangements**\n\n* The word \"SIXTEEN\" has 7 letters.\n* To find the total number of ways to arrange these letters, we use the factorial function: 7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040. \n\n**2. Arrangements Where the E's Are Together**\n\n* Treat the two \"E\"s as a single unit. Now we have 6 units to arrange (S, I, X, T, N, EE).\n* These 6 units can be arranged in 6! = 720 ways.\n* Since the two \"E\"s can switch places within their unit, we multiply by 2: 720 * 2 = 1440.\n\n**3. Arrangements Where the E's Are Not Together**\n\n* Subtract the number of arrangements where the \"E\"s are together from the total number of arrangements: 5040 - 1440 = 3600\n\n**4. Probability**\n\n* The probability of the \"E\"s not being together is the number of favorable arrangements (where the \"E\"s are not together) divided by the total number of arrangements: 3600 / 5040 = **5/7**\n\n**Therefore, the probability that the two \"E\"s are not next to each other when the letters of the word \"SIXTEEN\" are randomly arranged is 5/7.** \n"
