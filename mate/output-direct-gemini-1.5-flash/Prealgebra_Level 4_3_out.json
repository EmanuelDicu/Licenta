Find the relationship between wallops and fallops.**\n\n* We know 6 wallops = 5 ballops, and 3 ballops = 11 fallops.\n* To find the relationship between wallops and fallops, we need to eliminate ballops.\n* We can do this by finding a common multiple for the number of ballops in both equations: 15.\n*  Multiply the first equation by 3: (6 wallops = 5 ballops) * 3 = 18 wallops = 15 ballops.\n* Multiply the second equation by 5: (3 ballops = 11 fallops) * 5 = 15 ballops = 55 fallops.\n* Now we know 18 wallops = 55 fallops.\n\n**2.  Calculate how many wallops equal 110 fallops.**\n\n* We know 18 wallops = 55 fallops.\n*  Since 110 fallops is double 55 fallops, we can double the number of wallops: 18 wallops * 2 = 36 wallops.\n\n**Solution:**  36 wallops are equivalent to 110 fallops. \n"
