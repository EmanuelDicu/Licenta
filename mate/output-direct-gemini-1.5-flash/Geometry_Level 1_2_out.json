Identify Key Relationships:**\n\n* **Parallel Lines:**  We know that $\\overline{BC}$ is parallel to the segment through point $A$. This means the angles formed by these lines and the transversal (the line connecting points A and B) are related.\n* **Isosceles Triangle:** We are given that $AB = BC$, making triangle $ABC$ an isosceles triangle.  \n\n**2. Find Missing Angles:**\n\n* **Alternate Interior Angles:**  Since $\\overline{BC}$ is parallel to the segment through $A$, the angle marked $x$ and the angle labeled $124^\\circ$ are alternate interior angles.  Alternate interior angles are congruent, so $x = 124^\\circ$.\n\n**3. Solve for x:**\n\n* We have already found that $x = 124^\\circ$. \n\n**Solution:** The number of degrees represented by $x$ is **124**. \n"
