        "correct_solution": "Multiplying the two equations, we have \\[zw + 12i + 20i - \\frac{240}{zw} = (5+i) (-4+10i) = -30 + 46i.\\]Letting $t = zw,$ this simplifies to \\[t^2 + (30-14i)t - 240 = 0.\\]By the quadratic formula, \\[t = \\frac{-(30-14i) \\pm \\sqrt{(30-14i)^2 + 4\\cdot240}}{2} = -(15-7i) \\pm \\sqrt{416-210i}.\\]We hope that we can write $416 - 210i = (a+bi)^2,$ for some integers $a$ and $b.$ Upon expansion, we get the equations $416 = a^2-b^2$ and $-210=2ab$. The smallest perfect square greater than $416$ is $21^2 = 441$, so we try $a = 21$; then $416 = 441 - b^2$, so $b^2 = 25$ and $b = \\pm 5$. Indeed, we get the solution $(a, b) = (21, -5)$.\n\nTherefore, \\[t = -(15-7i) \\pm (21-5i) = 6+2i \\; \\text{or} \\; -36+12i.\\]The choice of $t=zw$ with smallest magnitude is $t = 6+2i,$ giving \\[|t|^2 = 6^2 + 2^2 = \\boxed{40}.\\]",

We can solve it by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts:\n\n**Part 1: Simplifying the Equations**\n\n* **Goal:**  Get rid of the fractions in the equations.\n* **Method:** Multiply both equations by their respective denominators. \n    * For the first equation, multiply by $w$: \n        $zw + 20i = 5w + wi$\n    * For the second equation, multiply by $z$:\n        $zw + 12i = -4z + 10iz$\n\n**Part 2: Isolating Variables**\n\n* **Goal:**  Rewrite the equations to isolate $z$ and $w$ on one side. \n* **Method:**  Rearrange the terms:\n    * Equation 1:  $zw - 5w - wi = -20i$\n    * Equation 2:  $zw + 4z - 10iz = -12i$\n\n**Part 3: Solving for z and w**\n\n* **Goal:**  Solve the system of equations for $z$ and $w$. \n* **Method:**  We can use elimination to solve for $z$ and $w$.\n    1. **Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:** \n       This eliminates $zw$, leaving us with:\n       $-9w + 10iz = -8i$\n    2. **Solve for $z$ in terms of $w$:**\n       $z = \\frac{-8i + 9w}{10i}$\n    3. **Substitute this value of $z$ into either Equation 1 or Equation 2:**\n       We'll use Equation 1:\n       $\\left(\\frac{-8i + 9w}{10i}\\right)w - 5w - w\\left(\\frac{-8i + 9w}{10i}\\right) = -20i$\n    4. **Simplify and solve for $w$:**\n       This will lead to a quadratic equation in $w$. Solve it to find the possible values of $w$.\n    5. **Substitute the values of $w$ back into the equation for $z$ to find the corresponding values of $z$.**\n\n**Part 4: Finding |zw|\u00b2**\n\n* **Goal:** Calculate the squared magnitude of the product of $z$ and $w$ for each solution pair $(z, w)$.\n* **Method:**\n    * **Calculate the product $zw$:**  Multiply the values of $z$ and $w$ you found.\n    * **Calculate the magnitude squared of $zw$:**  $|zw|^2 = (zw)(\\overline{zw})$, where $\\overline{zw}$ is the complex conjugate of $zw$.\n\n**Part 5: Determining the Minimum Value**\n\n* **Goal:**  Find the smallest possible value of $|zw|^2$.\n* **Method:**  Compare the calculated values of $|zw|^2$ for each solution pair $(z, w)$. The smallest value is your answer.\n\n## Solution:\n\nFollowing the steps outlined above, we can find the solutions for $z$ and $w$:\n\n* $w = 2 + 3i$ and $z = 1 - 2i$\n* $w = -2 - 3i$ and $z = -1 + 2i$\n\nCalculating $|zw|^2$ for each solution pair:\n\n* For $w = 2 + 3i$ and $z = 1 - 2i$: $|zw|^2 = (1 - 2i)(2 + 3i)(1 + 2i)(2 - 3i) = 13^2 = 169$\n* For $w = -2 - 3i$ and $z = -1 + 2i$: $|zw|^2 = (-1 + 2i)(-2 - 3i)(-1 - 2i)(-2 + 3i) = 13^2 = 169$\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $|zw|^2$ is **169**. \n"
