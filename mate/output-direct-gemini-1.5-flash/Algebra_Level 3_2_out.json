            "gemini-1.5-flash": "Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Rearrange the Equation**\n\n* **Goal:** Get the equation in standard quadratic form (ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0).\n* **Steps:**\n    * Subtract 41t from both sides:  6t\u00b2 - 41t + 30 = 0\n\n**2. Factor the Quadratic Equation**\n\n* **Goal:** Find two numbers that add up to -41 and multiply to (6 * 30) = 180.\n* **Steps:**\n    * After some trial and error, we find that -36 and -5 satisfy these conditions. \n    * Rewrite the equation: 6t\u00b2 - 36t - 5t + 30 = 0\n    * Factor by grouping: 6t(t - 6) - 5(t - 6) = 0\n    * Factor out (t - 6): (t - 6)(6t - 5) = 0\n\n**3. Solve for 't'**\n\n* **Goal:** Find the values of 't' that make the equation true.\n* **Steps:**\n    * Set each factor equal to zero:\n        * t - 6 = 0  => t = 6\n        * 6t - 5 = 0 => t = 5/6\n\n**4. Determine the Positive Difference**\n\n* **Goal:** Find the difference between the two solutions and take the absolute value (since we want the positive difference).\n* **Steps:**\n    * The solutions are t = 6 and t = 5/6.\n    * The difference is 6 - 5/6 = 31/6\n\n**Solution:** The positive difference between the solutions is **31/6**. \n"
