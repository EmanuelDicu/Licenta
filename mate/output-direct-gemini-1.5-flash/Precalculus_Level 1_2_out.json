The magnitude of a complex number represents its distance from the origin in the complex plane.\n\n**Solving the Problem**\n\n1. **Calculate the product 'ab':**\n   *  Multiply the two complex numbers using the distributive property (FOIL method):\n      * (5 - 8i)(30 + 48i) = (5 * 30) + (5 * 48i) + (-8i * 30) + (-8i * 48i)\n      * = 150 + 240i - 240i - 384i\u00b2 \n      * Remember that i\u00b2 = -1. Substitute this:\n      * = 150 - 384(-1)\n      * = 150 + 384 = 534\n\n2. **Calculate the magnitude of 'ab':**\n   * The magnitude of a complex number *a + bi* is calculated as: |*a + bi*| = \u221a(*a*\u00b2 + *b*\u00b2)\n   * In our case, *ab* = 534 + 0i. Therefore:\n      * |*ab*| = \u221a(534\u00b2 + 0\u00b2) = \u221a(534\u00b2) = 534\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe magnitude of the product of the complex numbers *a* and *b*, denoted as |*ab*|, is **534**. \n"
