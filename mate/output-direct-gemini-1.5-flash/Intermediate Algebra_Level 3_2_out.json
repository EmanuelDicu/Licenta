It represents the distance of the complex number from the origin in the complex plane.\n\n**Breaking Down the Problem**\n\n1. **Represent *z*:**  Let *z = x + yi*, where *x* and *y* are real numbers. \n\n2. **Calculate |*z*|:**  |z| = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\n3. **Substitute and Separate:** Substitute the expressions for *z* and |*z*| into the given equation:\n   (x + yi) + \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 2 + 8i\n\n4. **Equate Real and Imaginary Parts:**  Since two complex numbers are equal only if their real and imaginary parts are equal, we can separate the equation into two equations:\n   * x + \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 2  (Real part equation)\n   * y = 8                 (Imaginary part equation)\n\n**Solving the System of Equations**\n\n1. **Solve for *y*:**  We already have *y = 8* from the imaginary part equation.\n\n2. **Substitute *y*:** Substitute *y = 8* into the real part equation:\n    x + \u221a(x\u00b2 + 8\u00b2) = 2\n\n3. **Simplify and Solve for *x*:**\n    x + \u221a(x\u00b2 + 64) = 2\n    \u221a(x\u00b2 + 64) = 2 - x\n    x\u00b2 + 64 = (2 - x)\u00b2  (Squaring both sides)\n    x\u00b2 + 64 = 4 - 4x + x\u00b2\n    4x = -60\n    x = -15\n\n**Solution**\n\nTherefore, the complex number *z* that satisfies the equation is:\n\n*z = x + yi = -15 + 8i* \n"
