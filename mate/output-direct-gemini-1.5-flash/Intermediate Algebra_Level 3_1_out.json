        "correct_solution": "If $a_n =an + b$ and $b_n = cn + d$ are two arithmetic sequences, then their term-wise product takes the form \\[a_nb_n = (an+b)(cn+d) = An^2 + Bn + C,\\]where $A, B, C$ are constants. Therefore, some sequence $x_n = An^2 + Bn + C$ has $x_0 = 1440,$ $x_1 = 1716,$ and $x_2 = 1848.$ Then we have the equations \\[\\begin{aligned} C &= 1440, \\\\ A+B+C&=1716,\\\\  4A+2B+C&=1848. \\end{aligned}\\]Subtracting $C=1440$ from the second and third equations, we have $A+B=276$ and $4A+2B=408,$ or $2A+B=204.$ Then \\[A = (2A+B) - (A+B) = 204 - 276 = -72,\\]and so $B = 276-A=348.$ We conclude that the given sequence has the general formula \\[x_n = -72n^2 + 348n + 1440.\\]Then the eighth term is \\[\\begin{aligned} x_7 &= -72 \\cdot 7^2 + 348 \\cdot 7 + 1440 = \\boxed{348}. \\end{aligned}\\]",

Identify the Patterns:**\n\n* **Recognize Arithmetic Sequences:**  The problem states that the given sequence is formed by multiplying corresponding terms of two arithmetic sequences.  This means we need to find those two underlying arithmetic sequences.\n* **Look for Differences:** To find the common difference in an arithmetic sequence, subtract consecutive terms. \n    *  1716 - 1440 = 276\n    *  1848 - 1716 = 132\n\n**2. Find the First Arithmetic Sequence:**\n\n* **Notice the Difference:** The difference between the first two terms (276) is much larger than the difference between the second and third terms (132). This suggests the first arithmetic sequence has a larger common difference.\n* **Trial and Error:** Let's try dividing the first difference (276) by a few small numbers. We find that 276 is divisible by 12: 276 / 12 = 23.\n* **Check the Pattern:** If the first arithmetic sequence has a common difference of 12, the first few terms would be: 1440, 1440 + 12 = 1452, 1452 + 12 = 1464, ...  This pattern doesn't match the given sequence. \n* **Adjust the Difference:**  Let's try a slightly larger common difference. If the first arithmetic sequence has a common difference of 24, the first few terms would be: 1440, 1440 + 24 = 1464, 1464 + 24 = 1488, ... This also doesn't match.\n* **Find the Correct Difference:**  If the first arithmetic sequence has a common difference of 36, the first few terms would be: 1440, 1440 + 36 = 1476, 1476 + 36 = 1512, ... This pattern is still not right.\n* **The Key:**  We need to consider that the common difference might be larger than 36.  Let's try a difference of 48: 1440, 1440 + 48 = 1488, 1488 + 48 = 1536, ... This doesn't work either.\n* **The Solution:** Finally, if the first arithmetic sequence has a common difference of 60, the first few terms would be: 1440, 1440 + 60 = 1500, 1500 + 60 = 1560, ... This pattern matches the first two terms of the given sequence.\n\n**3. Find the Second Arithmetic Sequence:**\n\n* **Divide to Find the Pattern:**  Since we know the first term of the first arithmetic sequence is 1440, we can divide the first term of the given sequence (1440) by 1440 to find the first term of the second arithmetic sequence: 1440 / 1440 = 1.\n* **Calculate Differences:** We know the second arithmetic sequence must multiply with the first arithmetic sequence to produce the given sequence. Let's divide the third term of the given sequence by the third term of the first arithmetic sequence: 1848 / 1560 = 1.18. This is the second term of the second arithmetic sequence.\n* **Determine the Common Difference:** The difference between the first and second terms of the second arithmetic sequence is 1.18 - 1 = 0.18.\n* **Verify the Pattern:**  The second arithmetic sequence would be 1, 1.18, 1.36, 1.54, ...\n\n**4. Find the Eighth Term of the Sequence:**\n\n* **Extend the Arithmetic Sequences:**  To find the eighth term of the given sequence, we need the eighth terms of both arithmetic sequences.\n* **Find the Eighth Term of the First Sequence:**  The first arithmetic sequence is: 1440, 1500, 1560, ... To find the eighth term, we can add the common difference (60) seven times to the first term: 1440 + 60 * 7 = 1860.\n* **Find the Eighth Term of the Second Sequence:** The second arithmetic sequence is: 1, 1.18, 1.36, ... To find the eighth term, we can add the common difference (0.18) seven times to the first term: 1 + 0.18 * 7 = 2.26.\n* **Multiply to Find the Eighth Term:** The eighth term of the given sequence is the product of the eighth terms of the two arithmetic sequences: 1860 * 2.26 = **4203.6**. \n\n**Therefore, the eighth term of the sequence is 4203.6.** \n"
