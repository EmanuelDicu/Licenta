            "gemini-1.5-flash": "## Breaking down the problem:\n\nThe problem asks us to find the smallest base *b* for which 47 can be written using only two digits. This means we need to find a base *b* and two digits *a* and *c* such that:\n\n47 = a*b + c \n\nwhere *a* and *c* are integers less than *b*.\n\n**1. Finding the maximum possible value of b:**\n\n* Since *a* and *c* are less than *b*, the maximum value of the right side of the equation is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 - 1.\n* We know this maximum value must be greater than or equal to 47.\n* So, we have the inequality: b^2 - 1 >= 47\n* Solving for b, we get: b^2 >= 48, which means b >= 7 (since b is a whole number).\n\n**2. Finding the minimum possible value of b:**\n\n*  We know that *b* has to be greater than or equal to 7.\n* Let's try b = 7. We need to find two digits *a* and *c* less than 7 that satisfy the equation: 47 = 7a + c.\n* The only possible values for *a* are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n* For each value of *a*, we can calculate the corresponding value of *c*:\n    *  a = 1: c = 40 \n    *  a = 2: c = 33\n    *  a = 3: c = 26\n    *  a = 4: c = 19\n    *  a = 5: c = 12\n    *  a = 6: c = 5\n\n* We see that for a = 6 and c = 5, the equation holds true: 47 = 6 * 7 + 5.\n\n**3. Solution:**\n\n* We have found that 47 can be expressed in base 7 using the digits 6 and 5 (47 = 65_7).\n* We also know that b has to be greater than or equal to 7.\n* Therefore, the smallest possible value of *b* is **7**.\n\n**Solution:** The smallest whole number *b* such that 47 can be expressed in base *b* using only two digits is **b = 7**. \n"
