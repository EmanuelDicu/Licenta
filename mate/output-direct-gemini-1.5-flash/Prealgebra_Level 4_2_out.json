        "correct_solution": "Instead of adding up scores and figuring out the new averages, a quicker way (useful for the countdown round) is as follows:\n\nSince the average is 90, we first calculate how many points below 90 he already is: he's scored 87, 85, and 87, meaning that he is 3, 5, and 3 points below 90 respectively, making for a total of 11 points below.  We then know that his remaining two tests must be a combined 11 points above 90, and since they differ by 3 points, we know that one test is 4 above 90, and the other is 7 above 90, meaning his highest score was $\\boxed{97}$.",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "Here's how to break down the problem and solve it:\n\n**1. Calculate the Total Points Needed**\n\n* Ed needs a 90% average on 5 tests, so he needs a total of 5 tests * 90 points/test = 450 points.\n\n**2. Calculate the Points from the First Three Tests**\n\n* Ed scored 87 + 85 + 87 = 259 points on the first three tests.\n\n**3. Calculate the Points Needed on the Last Two Tests**\n\n* To reach his goal of 450 points, Ed needs 450 points - 259 points = 191 points on his last two tests.\n\n**4. Set Up an Equation for the Last Two Tests**\n\n* Let 'x' be the higher score on the last two tests. \n* The lower score is 'x - 3' (since they differ by 3 points).\n* The equation is: x + (x - 3) = 191\n\n**5. Solve for the Higher Score (x)**\n\n* Combine like terms: 2x - 3 = 191\n* Add 3 to both sides: 2x = 194\n* Divide both sides by 2: x = 97\n\n**Solution:** Ed's highest test score was **97**. \n"
