        "correct_solution": "Notice that $(a+1)(a-5) = a^2 - 4a - 5$, so $a^2 - 4a + 1 = (a+1)(a-5) + 6$.\n\nAlso, we know that by the Euclidean algorithm, the greatest common divisor of $a+1$ and $a-5$ divides $6$: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(a+1, a-5) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(a+1-(a-5),a-5)\\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(6,a-5).\n\\end{align*}As $10508$ is even but not divisible by $3$, for the sum of the digits of $10508$ is $1 + 5 + 8 = 14$, it follows that the greatest common divisor of $a+1$ and $a-5$ must be $2$.\n\nFrom the identity $xy = \\text{lcm}\\,(x,y) \\cdot \\text{gcd}\\,(x,y)$ (consider the exponents of the prime numbers in the prime factorization of $x$ and $y$), it follows that \\begin{align*}\n(a+1)(a-5) &= \\text{lcm}\\,(a+1,a-5) \\cdot \\text{gcd}\\,(a+1, a-5) \\\\\n&= 2 \\cdot 10508.\n\\end{align*}Thus, the desired answer is $2 \\cdot 10508 + 6 = \\boxed{21022}.$\n\nWith a bit more work, we can find that $a = 147$.",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Prime Factorization**\n\n* **Understanding the Problem:** The problem tells us that the least common multiple (LCM) of  (a+1) and (a-5) is 10508.  We need to find the value of  a\u00b2 - 4a + 1.\n* **Key Idea:** To work with LCMs, it's often helpful to break down the numbers into their prime factorizations.\n* **Calculate the Prime Factorization of 10508:**\n   * 10508 = 2\u00b2 * 3 * 13 * 67\n\n**2. Finding Possible Factors of (a + 1) and (a - 5)**\n\n* **Understanding the LCM:**  The LCM of two numbers contains all the prime factors of both numbers, raised to the highest power that appears in either number.\n* **Possible Factors:** Since 10508 has the prime factors 2, 3, 13, and 67, the numbers (a+1) and (a-5) must be formed using some combination of these prime factors. \n\n**3.  Testing Possibilities**\n\n* **Trial and Error:**  Let's start by considering the prime factor 2. Since the LCM has 2\u00b2, either (a+1) or (a-5) must have a factor of 2\u00b2, while the other may have a factor of 2 or no factor of 2. \n* **Checking for Divisibility by 3:** If (a+1) is divisible by 3, then (a-5) is not divisible by 3 (and vice-versa). This is because the difference between (a+1) and (a-5) is 6, which is divisible by 3.\n* **Checking for Divisibility by 13:** Similar to the divisibility by 3, if (a+1) is divisible by 13, then (a-5) is not divisible by 13 (and vice-versa).\n* **Checking for Divisibility by 67:** The same principle applies to divisibility by 67.\n\n**4. Solving for 'a'**\n\n* **Finding a Combination:** We need to find values for 'a' where the prime factors of (a+1) and (a-5) satisfy the conditions of the LCM.  \n* **Testing Possibilities:** After some trial and error, we find that if:\n   *  (a + 1) = 2\u00b2 * 3 * 67 = 804\n   *  (a - 5) = 13\n*  Then, a = 803 and a = 18.\n* **Verifying the Solution:**  The LCM of 804 and 13 is indeed 10508.\n\n**5.  Calculating a\u00b2 - 4a + 1**\n\n* **Final Step:** Now that we know a = 803, we can substitute this into the expression a\u00b2 - 4a + 1.\n* **Calculation:** 803\u00b2 - 4 * 803 + 1 = 644809 - 3212 + 1 = **641598**\n\n**Therefore, the solution to the problem is a\u00b2 - 4a + 1 = 641598.** \n"
