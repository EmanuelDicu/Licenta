The key is that each person can only hold *one* role. \n\n**Breaking Down the Problem**\n\n1. **Choosing the President:**  We have 8 options for who can be President.\n\n2. **Choosing the Vice-President:** After we've chosen the President, we only have 7 people left.  So, there are 7 options for the Vice-President.\n\n3. **Choosing the Treasurer:** With the President and Vice-President chosen, we have 6 people remaining.  Therefore, there are 6 options for the Treasurer.\n\n**Calculating the Total Number of Ways**\n\nTo find the total number of ways to choose these roles, we multiply the number of options at each step:\n\n* 8 options (President) * 7 options (Vice-President) * 6 options (Treasurer) = 336\n\n**Solution**\n\nThere are **336** ways to choose a President, Vice-President, and Treasurer from a group of 8 people if no one can hold multiple roles. \n"
