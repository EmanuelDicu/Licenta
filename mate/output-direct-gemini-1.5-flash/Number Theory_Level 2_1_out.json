        "correct_solution": "Note that for $n\\geq 2$, the last two digits of $5^n$ are 25.  To prove this, note that $5^2\\equiv 25 \\pmod{100}$, and whenever $5^{n-1}\\equiv 25\\pmod{100}$, we also have $5^n=5\\cdot 5^{n-1}\\equiv 5\\cdot 25 \\equiv 125 \\equiv 25 \\pmod{100}$.

Directly calculating this number would be computationally challenging. Instead, we'll use patterns in the units digit to figure out the tens digit.\n\n**Breaking Down the Problem**\n\n1. **Units Digit Pattern:** Let's start by looking at the units digit of the first few powers of 5:\n   *  5\u00b9 = 5\n   *  5\u00b2 = 25\n   *  5\u00b3 = 125\n   *  5\u2074 = 625\n   *  5\u2075 = 3125\n\n   Notice the units digit cycles through the pattern: 5, 5, 5, 5, ...\n\n2. **Implication for Tens Digit:** Since the units digit is always 5, the tens digit depends on what happens to the 'carry-over' from the units digit when we multiply. \n\n   * If the units digit is 5, and we multiply by 5 again, we'll get a units digit of 5 and a carry-over of 2. \n   * This carry-over will affect the tens digit.\n\n**Finding the Tens Digit**\n\n1. **Focus on the Carry-over:**  Since the units digit is always 5,  we only need to focus on the carry-over. Every time we multiply by 5, we get a carry-over of 2.\n\n2. **Counting the Carry-overs:**  In  $5^{2005}$, we're multiplying by 5 a total of 2005 times.  This means we'll have a carry-over of 2 a total of 2005 times.\n\n3. **Calculating the Tens Digit:** To get the tens digit, we need to see how many times 2005 is divisible by 10 (since every carry-over of 10 contributes to the tens digit).  2005 is not divisible by 10, but it's divisible by 5 with a remainder of 5.\n\n   * This remainder of 5 tells us that we have an extra carry-over of 10 from the units digit.  \n   * Since we already have a carry-over of 2 (from the units digit being 5), the total carry-over is 2 + 10 = 12.\n\n4. **Final Tens Digit:**  The tens digit is determined by the carry-over, and since we have a carry-over of 12, the tens digit of $5^{2005}$ is **1**.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe tens digit of $5^{2005}$ is **1**. \n"
