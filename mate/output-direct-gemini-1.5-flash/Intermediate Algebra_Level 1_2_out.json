For a cubic polynomial like the one given, we have:\n    * **Sum of Roots:**  *a + b + c = - (coefficient of x\u00b2 term) / (coefficient of x\u00b3 term)*\n    * **Product of Roots:** *a * b * c = -(constant term) / (coefficient of x\u00b3 term)*\n\n**Solution**\n\n1. **Identify the Coefficients:**\n   * The coefficient of the x\u00b2 term is 7.\n   * The coefficient of the x\u00b3 term is 1.\n\n2. **Apply the Sum of Roots Formula:**\n   *  *a + b + c = - (7) / (1) = -7*\n\n**Answer**\n\nTherefore, *a + b + c = -7*. \n"
