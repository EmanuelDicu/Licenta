Solving for $x$ and $y$, we find $x = 16$ and $y = 24$.  Hence, the perimeter of one of the five congruent rectangles is $2x + 2y = \\boxed{80}$.",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\n* We have a large rectangle divided into five identical smaller rectangles.\n* We know the perimeter of the large rectangle is 176.\n* We need to find the perimeter of one of the smaller rectangles.\n\n**2.  Label the Dimensions**\n\n* Let the length of the large rectangle be 'l' and the width be 'w'.\n* Let the length of each small rectangle be 'x' and the width be 'y'.\n\n**3.  Set Up Equations**\n\n* **Perimeter of large rectangle:** 2l + 2w = 176 \n* **Relationship between dimensions:** \n    * l = 3x (The length of the large rectangle is three times the length of a small rectangle)\n    * w = 2y (The width of the large rectangle is twice the width of a small rectangle)\n\n**4.  Solve for 'x' and 'y'**\n\n* Substitute the relationships from step 3 into the perimeter equation:\n    * 2(3x) + 2(2y) = 176\n    * 6x + 4y = 176\n* Divide the entire equation by 2:\n    * 3x + 2y = 88\n* Now we have one equation with two unknowns. We need another equation.  Notice that the large rectangle's length (3x) is made up of three smaller rectangle's lengths (x) and its width (2y) is made up of two smaller rectangle's widths (y). This means we can express the perimeter of the large rectangle in terms of the small rectangle's dimensions:\n    * 176 = 2(3x) + 2(2y)\n    * 176 = 6x + 4y \n* We now have two equations:\n    * 3x + 2y = 88\n    * 6x + 4y = 176\n* We can solve for 'x' and 'y' using substitution or elimination. Here's the solution using elimination:\n    * Multiply the first equation by -2: -6x - 4y = -176\n    * Add this equation to the second equation: 0 = 0\n    * This means the equations are dependent, and there are infinitely many solutions. However, we can still find a valid solution for 'x' and 'y'.\n    * Let's simplify the first equation by dividing by 2: 1.5x + y = 44\n    * Let's assume y = 11 (we can choose any value for 'y' and find a corresponding 'x').\n    * Substitute y = 11 into the simplified equation: 1.5x + 11 = 44\n    * Solve for x: 1.5x = 33, x = 22\n\n**5. Find the Perimeter of a Small Rectangle**\n\n* The perimeter of a small rectangle is 2x + 2y.\n* Substitute x = 22 and y = 11:\n    * Perimeter = 2(22) + 2(11) = 44 + 22 = 66\n\n**Solution:** The perimeter of one of the five congruent rectangles is **66**. \n"
