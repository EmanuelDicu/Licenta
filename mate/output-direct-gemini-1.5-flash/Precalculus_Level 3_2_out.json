The vertices P, Q, and R are three corners of this cube.\n* **Goal:** We want to find the distance between any two adjacent vertices of the cube, which represents the side length. \n\n**2. Key Insight**\n\n* **Edges and Faces:**  PQ, QR, and RP form three edges of the cube. Since it's a cube, these edges are all the same length and form a square on one face of the cube. \n\n**3. Solving for the Side Length**\n\n* **Distance Formula:** We'll use the 3D distance formula to find the length of any of the edges PQ, QR, or RP.  The distance between points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) is:\n   \u221a[(x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2 + (z2 - z1)\u00b2]\n\n* **Calculate PQ:**\n    *  PQ = \u221a[(8 - 7)\u00b2 + (8 - 12)\u00b2 + (1 - 10)\u00b2] \n    *  PQ = \u221a[1\u00b2 + (-4)\u00b2 + (-9)\u00b2] \n    *  PQ = \u221a(98) = 7\u221a2 \n\n* **Conclusion:** The side length of the cube is **7\u221a2**.  (We don't need to calculate QR or RP, since the side length is the same for all edges of a cube.) \n"
