        "correct_solution": "The only way for the Dora to end up at her starting point in four steps is for her to traverse the four sides of the gray square.  She can do this in two ways: clockwise and counterclockwise. The probability of each of these two paths is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^4=\\frac{1}{256}$.  Therefore, the probability that she ends up where she started is $\\dfrac{1}{256}+\\dfrac{1}{256}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{128}}$.",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Identify the successful paths**\n\n* Dora needs to walk completely around the gray square.  This means she must visit all four corners of the square in some order.\n* There are only two ways to do this:\n    * **Clockwise:** A-right-down-left-up\n    * **Counterclockwise:** A-left-down-right-up\n\n**2. Calculate the probability of one successful path**\n\n* Let's take the clockwise path as an example. \n* The probability of going right from point A is 1/4.\n* The probability of going down from the next intersection is also 1/4 (since there are four possible directions).\n* The same applies to the next two steps.\n* Therefore, the probability of the clockwise path is (1/4) * (1/4) * (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/256\n\n**3. Realize the counterclockwise path has the same probability**\n\n*  The counterclockwise path has the same probability of 1/256 as the clockwise path, as the individual probabilities for each step are the same.\n\n**4.  Add the probabilities of the two successful paths**\n\n* Since Dora can successfully complete the path either clockwise or counterclockwise, we add the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events.\n* Total probability = 1/256 + 1/256 = 2/256\n\n**5. Simplify the fraction**\n\n* The fraction 2/256 can be simplified to **1/128**.\n\n**Solution:** The probability that Dora will walk completely around the gray square in her first four steps is **1/128**. \n"
