        "correct_solution": "When an image is translated to the right we just add the number of units it is being translated to the original $x$-coordinate. When an image is translated down we just subtract that number of units from the $y$-coordinate. In this case we'll subtract 2 from the $y$-coordinates and add 3 to the   $x$-coordinates. This will make point $B(6, 5)$ move to $B'(6 + 3, 5 - 2) = \\boxed{(9, 3)}$.",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understand the problem:**\n\n* We are given a parallelogram with its vertices.\n* We need to translate the parallelogram, which means moving it without changing its shape or size.\n* We need to find the final position of point B after the translation.\n\n**2. Break down the translation:**\n\n* The problem states a translation \"down 2 units and right 3 units\".  This means:\n    * **Down 2 units:**  Subtract 2 from the y-coordinate of each point.\n    * **Right 3 units:** Add 3 to the x-coordinate of each point.\n\n**3. Apply the translation to point B:**\n\n* Point B has coordinates (6, 5).\n*  **Down 2 units:**  (6, 5) becomes (6, 5 - 2) = (6, 3)\n*  **Right 3 units:** (6, 3) becomes (6 + 3, 3) = (9, 3)\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe final image of point B after the translation will be at the coordinates **(9, 3)**. \n"
