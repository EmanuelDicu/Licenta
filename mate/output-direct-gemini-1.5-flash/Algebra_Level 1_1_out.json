        "correct_solution": "Because the question only asks for the value of $m$, we can begin by eliminating $n$. In order to do this, we multiply the second equation by 4, giving us a system of two equations where both coefficients of $n$ are 4: \\begin{align*} 3m+4n=47\n\\\\ 4m+4n=60\n\\end{align*}From here, we can just subtract the second equation from the first. This gives us $(3m+4n)-(4m+4n)=47-60$, which simplifies to $-m=-13$ or $m=\\boxed{13}$.",

Use Elimination to Eliminate 'n':**\n\n* Notice that both equations have 'n' in them.  We can eliminate 'n' by multiplying the second equation by -4. This will allow us to add the two equations together and have 'n' cancel out.\n\n* **Multiply the second equation by -4:** \n   -4 * (m + n) = -4 * 15\n   -4m - 4n = -60\n\n**3.  Add the Modified Equations:**\n\n* Now we have:\n    * 3m + 4n = 47\n    * -4m - 4n = -60\n\n* Add these two equations together: \n   (3m - 4m) + (4n - 4n) = 47 - 60\n   -m = -13\n\n**4. Isolate 'm':**\n\n* Divide both sides of the equation by -1:\n   -m / -1 = -13 / -1\n   m = 13\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe value of 'm' is **13**. \n"
