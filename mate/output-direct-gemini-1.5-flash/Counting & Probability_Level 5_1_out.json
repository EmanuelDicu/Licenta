        "correct_solution": "The only one-digit integer divisible by $4$ that we can construct is $4$.\n\nWe can construct $3$ two-digit integers divisible by $4$: $12$, $32$, and $24$.\n\nAn integer is divisible by $4$ if its rightmost two digits are divisible by $4$.  Thus we can append either or both of the remaining two digits to any of these two-digit integers and preserve divisibility by $4$.  For each, there are $2$ ways to choose one digit to append, and $2$ ways to order the digits if we append both of them.  Thus we get $4$ more integers for each, or $12$ total.\n\nThe full number is $12+3+1=\\boxed{16}$ integers.",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "Here's how to break down the problem and find the solution:\n\n**Understanding the Constraints**\n\n* **Divisible by 4:**  A number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits are divisible by 4.\n* **Unique Digits:** We can only use each of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 once. \n* **Positive Integers:** Our numbers must be greater than zero.\n\n**Breaking Down the Problem**\n\n1. **Possible Last Two Digits:**  We need to figure out how many two-digit combinations we can create using 1, 2, 3, and 4 that are divisible by 4.  Let's list them:\n   * 12\n   * 24\n   * 32\n   * 44\n\n2. **Building the Numbers:** For each of the valid last two digits, we can add the remaining digits to the front to create a three-digit or four-digit number.  Let's consider each case:\n\n   * **Case 1: Last Two Digits are 12**\n      * We have two remaining digits (3 and 4), so we have 2 choices for the hundreds digit and 1 choice for the thousands digit (if we're forming a four-digit number). This gives us 2 * 1 = 2 possibilities: 3412 and 4312.\n\n   * **Case 2: Last Two Digits are 24**\n      * We have two choices for the hundreds digit (1 and 3), and one choice for the thousands digit (if applicable). This gives us 2 * 1 = 2 possibilities: 1324 and 3124.\n\n   * **Case 3: Last Two Digits are 32**\n      * We have two choices for the hundreds digit (1 and 4), and one choice for the thousands digit (if applicable). This gives us 2 * 1 = 2 possibilities: 1432 and 4132.\n\n   * **Case 4: Last Two Digits are 44**\n      * We have two choices for the hundreds digit (1 and 3), and one choice for the thousands digit (if applicable). This gives us 2 * 1 = 2 possibilities: 1344 and 3144.\n\n**Final Count**\n\nAdding up the possibilities from each case, we have a total of 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **8** different positive integers divisible by 4 that can be formed using the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 at most once. \n"
