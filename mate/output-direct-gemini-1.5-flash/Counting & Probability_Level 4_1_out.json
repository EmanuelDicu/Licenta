        "problem": "Liz has 11 marbles of different colors. In how many ways can she choose 3 of the marbles, if she refuses to choose the green one and the purple one at the same time?",
        "correct_solution": "We can divide this into cases:\n\nCase 1: Liz chooses the green marble, and not the purple marble. In this case, Liz must choose 2 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles (since she won't choose the purple marble). So, there are $\\binom{9}{2}=36$ choices in this case.\n\nCase 2: Liz chooses the purple marble, and not the green marble. As in Case 1, Liz must choose 2 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles. So, there are $\\binom{9}{2}$ choices in this case.\n\nCase 3: Liz chooses neither the green marble nor the purple marble. In this case, Liz must choose three marbles from the nine remaining marbles, and there are $\\binom{9}{3}=84$ choices in this case.\n\nThe total number of possible choices is $36+36+84=\\boxed{156}$.\n\nAlternatively, there are $\\binom{11}{3}=165$ ways to select three marbles. Of those, $\\binom{9}{1}=9$ ways contain both the purple marble and the green marble. Therefore, there are $165-9=\\boxed{156}$ ways to select three marbles such that purple and green marbles are not both chosen.",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n**1.  Calculate the total possible ways to choose 3 marbles without any restrictions.**\n\n* Liz has 11 marbles and needs to choose 3.  This is a combination problem (order doesn't matter).\n* The formula for combinations is:  nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!) \n* In this case, n = 11 (total marbles) and r = 3 (marbles chosen).\n* So, the total number of ways to choose 3 marbles is: 11C3 = 11! / (3! * 8!) = 165\n\n**2.  Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 marbles including both the green and purple marbles.**\n\n* If Liz must choose both the green and purple marbles, she only has one more marble to select from the remaining 9.\n* The number of ways to choose 1 marble out of 9 is: 9C1 = 9! / (1! * 8!) = 9\n\n**3.  Subtract the invalid combinations from the total combinations.**\n\n* We've calculated the total possible combinations (165) and the combinations where she chooses both the green and purple marbles (9).\n* To find the number of ways Liz can choose 3 marbles without picking both green and purple, subtract the invalid combinations: 165 - 9 = 156\n\n**Solution:** There are **156** ways Liz can choose 3 marbles without choosing both the green and purple marbles at the same time. \n"
