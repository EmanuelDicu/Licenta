Since we want the answer as a residue modulo 11, our solution will be a number between 0 and 10.\n\n**Solving the Congruence**\n\n1. **Find the Modular Inverse of 3 (mod 11):**  \n   To isolate *n*, we need to multiply both sides of the congruence by the modular inverse of 3 (modulo 11).  The modular inverse of 3 is a number *x* such that:\n   3 * x  \u2261 1  (mod 11)\n\n   We can find this by trial and error, checking multiples of 3:\n   * 3 * 4 = 12 \u2261 1 (mod 11)\n\n   Therefore, the modular inverse of 3 (mod 11) is 4.\n\n2. **Multiply Both Sides by the Modular Inverse:** \n   Multiply both sides of the original congruence by 4:\n   4 * (3n) \u2261 4 * 2 (mod 11)\n\n3. **Simplify:**\n   12n \u2261 8 (mod 11)\n   Since 12 \u2261 1 (mod 11), we have:\n   n \u2261 8 (mod 11)\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe solution to the congruence $3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$ is  **n = 8**. \n"
