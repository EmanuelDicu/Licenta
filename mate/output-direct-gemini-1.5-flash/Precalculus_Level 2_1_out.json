This comes from the fact that sine is a periodic function with a period of 360\u00b0.\n* **Apply to our Equation:**  Applying this to our equation, we have:\n   * 3\u03b8 = (90\u00b0 - 7\u03b8) + 360\u00b0k   OR   3\u03b8 = 180\u00b0 - (90\u00b0 - 7\u03b8) + 360\u00b0k\n* **Simplify and Solve:** \n    * From the first equation: 10\u03b8 = 90\u00b0 + 360\u00b0k  =>  \u03b8 = 9\u00b0 + 36\u00b0k\n    * From the second equation:  -4\u03b8 = 90\u00b0 + 360\u00b0k  =>  \u03b8 = -22.5\u00b0 - 90\u00b0k\n\n**Part 4: Finding the Smallest Positive Angle**\n\n* **Smallest Positive Value:**  To find the smallest positive value of \u03b8, we need to consider the values of k that give us positive angles.  \n* **For the first solution:**  The smallest positive angle occurs when k = 0, giving \u03b8 = 9\u00b0.\n* **For the second solution:** There are no values of k that would give us a positive angle.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe smallest positive angle \u03b8 for which sin 3\u03b8 = cos 7\u03b8 is **9 degrees**. \n"
