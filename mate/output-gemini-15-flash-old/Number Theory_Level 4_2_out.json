        "correct_solution": "We can rewrite $AAA_4$ and $33_b$ to get \\begin{align*}\n16A+4A+A&=3b+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n21A&=3b+3.\n\\end{align*}The smallest possible value for $A$ is 1, which gives us $21=3b+3$ and $b=6$. So the smallest sum $A+b=\\boxed{7}$. While there are other values for $A$ and $b$ that work, increasing $A$ will increase $b$, resulting in a larger sum.",

Substituting into our equation, we get $7A = 7$, so $A=1$.\n\n6. **Calculate the sum A + b:** \n    The smallest possible sum is $A + b = 1 + 6 = \\boxed{7}$. \n"
