We also know the coordinates of three of the vertices: A(0, 0), B(0, 4), and D(x, 0).\n\n2. **Determine the dimensions of the rectangle:** The length of the rectangle is the distance between points A and D, which is simply *x*. The width of the rectangle is the distance between points A and B, which is 4.\n\n3. **Use the area formula:** The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width. We know the area is 28 and we've determined the length is *x* and the width is 4. Therefore, we can write the equation: *x* * 4 = 28.\n\n4. **Solve for x:** Dividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get *x* = 7.\n\n**Solution:** The value of *x* is **7**. \n"
