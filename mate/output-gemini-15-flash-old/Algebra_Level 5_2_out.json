        "correct_solution": "Completing the square gives us $(x+3)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 13 - c$. Since we want the radius to be 4, we must have $13 - c = 4^2$. It follows that $c = \\boxed{-3}$.",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "1. **Rewrite the equation in standard form:** To find the radius, we need to rewrite the equation in standard form for a circle: $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h,k)$ is the center and $r$ is the radius. \n\n2. **Complete the square:** We complete the square for both the $x$ and $y$ terms.  To complete the square for $x$, we take half of the coefficient of $x$ (which is 6), square it (which is 9), and add it to both sides of the equation.  Similarly, we take half of the coefficient of $y$ (which is -4), square it (which is 4), and add it to both sides: \n  \n  $x^2 + 6x + 9 + y^2 - 4y + 4 + c = 9 + 4$\n\n3. **Rewrite the equation in standard form:** Now, we can rewrite the left side of the equation as squared terms:\n\n  $(x+3)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 13 - c$\n\n4. **Use the given radius:** We are given that the radius of the circle is 4.  This means $r^2 = 4^2 = 16$.\n\n5. **Solve for c:** Since the right side of the standard form equation is $r^2$, we set $13-c$ equal to 16 and solve for $c$:\n\n  $13 - c = 16$\n  $-c = 3$\n  $c = -3$\n\n**Therefore, the value of $c$ that makes the circle have a radius of 4 is $\\boxed{-3}$.** \n"
