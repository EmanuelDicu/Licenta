            "gemini-1.5-flash": "1. **Identify the relationship between the square and the circles:**  Each circle touches two sides of the square and another circle. \n2. **Find the side length of the square:**  The diameter of each circle is 10 inches (twice the radius). Since two diameters fit along one side of the square, the side length of the square is 10 inches + 10 inches = 20 inches.\n3. **Calculate the area of the square:** The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the square is 20 inches * 20 inches = **400 square inches**. \n"
