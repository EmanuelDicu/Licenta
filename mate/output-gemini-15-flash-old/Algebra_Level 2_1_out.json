            "gemini-1.5-flash": "1. **Set up the equation:** The area of a rectangle is length times width. We know the area is 51, and the length and width are given in terms of *m*. So, we can write the equation: (2*m + 7)(m - 2) = 51.\n\n2. **Expand the equation:** Multiply out the left side of the equation: 2*m^2 + 3*m - 14 = 51.\n\n3. **Move all terms to one side:** Subtract 51 from both sides to get a quadratic equation: 2*m^2 + 3*m - 65 = 0.\n\n4. **Factor the quadratic:** Factor the quadratic equation: (2*m + 13)(m - 5) = 0.\n\n5. **Solve for m:**  For the product of two factors to be zero, at least one of them must be zero. So, we have two possible solutions:\n   * 2*m + 13 = 0  => m = -13/2\n   * m - 5 = 0  => m = 5\n\n6. **Choose the valid solution:** Since the dimensions of a field cannot be negative, we discard m = -13/2. Therefore, the value of m is **5**. \n"
