        "correct_solution": "In order to get the greatest possible $q-r$, we want to maximize $q$ and minimize $r$. We divide 839 by 19 to find the maximum $q$. The quotient $q$ is 44 and the remainder $r$ is 3, and we can check that $839=19(44)+3$. So the greatest possible value of $q-r=44-3=\\boxed{41}$.",

We need to find the greatest possible value of q-r.\n\n**2. Find the maximum value of q:**\nTo maximize q, we need to minimize r. The smallest possible value for r is 1, since it is a positive integer. \nTherefore, 839 = 19q + 1\nSolving for q, we get q = (839-1)/19 = 44.\n\n**3. Find the corresponding value of r:**\nUsing q = 44, we can find r: \n839 = 19(44) + r\nr = 839 - 836 = 3\n\n**4. Calculate q - r:**\nq - r = 44 - 3 = 41\n\n**Solution:** The greatest possible value of q - r is **41**. \n"
