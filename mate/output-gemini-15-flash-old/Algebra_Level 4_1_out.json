These are the equations of two lines.\n\n* **Visualizing the Lines:**\n    * The line x = 2y has a slope of 1/2 and passes through the origin.\n    * The line y = 2x has a slope of 2 and also passes through the origin.\n\n* **Regions Formed:** These two lines divide the coordinate plane into four distinct regions. \n"
