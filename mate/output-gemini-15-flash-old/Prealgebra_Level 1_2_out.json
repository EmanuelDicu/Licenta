            "gemini-1.5-flash": "1. **Understand the problem:** We know the perimeter of a polygon is the total length of all its sides. We also know the length of each side. We need to find the number of sides.\n\n2. **Set up the equation:** Let 'n' be the number of sides. Since each side is 12 cm long, the perimeter is 12n cm. We are given the perimeter is 108 cm. So, 12n = 108.\n\n3. **Solve for 'n':** Divide both sides of the equation by 12: n = 108/12 = 9.\n\n**Solution:** The polygon has **9** sides. \n"
