We can do this by finding a common denominator:\n\\[\\frac{n}{2} + \\frac{18}{n} = \\frac{n^2}{2n} + \\frac{36}{2n} = \\frac{n^2 + 36}{2n}.\\]\n\n**Part 2:  Analyze the expression and apply AM-GM inequality.**\n\nWe want to minimize the value of $\\frac{n^2 + 36}{2n}$. Notice that the numerator is always positive since $n^2$ is always non-negative. The denominator is also always positive since $n$ is positive.\n\nThe Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality states that for non-negative numbers $a$ and $b$,\n\\[\\frac{a + b}{2} \\ge \\sqrt{ab},\\]with equality if and only if $a = b$.\n\nLet's apply AM-GM to the numerator of our expression, $n^2 + 36$.  We have\n\\[\\frac{n^2 + 36}{2} \\ge \\sqrt{n^2 \\cdot 36} = 6n.\\]Multiplying both sides by 2, we get\n\\[n^2 + 36 \\ge 12n.\\]\n\n**Part 3:  Minimize the expression.**\n\nSince $n^2 + 36 \\ge 12n$, we have\n\\[\\frac{n^2 + 36}{2n} \\ge \\frac{12n}{2n} = 6.\\]Equality occurs when $n^2 = 36$, or $n = 6$ (since $n$ is positive).\n\nTherefore, the smallest value of $\\frac{n}{2} + \\frac{18}{n}$ is $\\boxed{6}$, which occurs when $n = 6$.\n"
