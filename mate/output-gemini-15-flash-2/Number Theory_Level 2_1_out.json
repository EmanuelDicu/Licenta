The quotient $q$ is 44 and the remainder $r$ is 3, and we can check that $839=19(44)+3$. So the greatest possible value of $q-r=44-3=\\boxed{41}$.",

So, we want to find the largest possible value of $q$.\n\nTo maximize $q$, we want to minimize $r$.  The smallest possible value for $r$ is 0.\n\nIf $r=0$, then $839 = 19q$.  Solving for $q$, we get $q = 839/19 = 44\\frac{3}{19}$. Since $q$ must be an integer, the largest possible value of $q$ is 44.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $q-r$ is $44-0 = \\boxed{44}$. \n"
