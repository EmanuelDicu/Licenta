We need to find the number of sides.\n\n2. **Relating perimeter and sides:** The perimeter of a polygon is the total length of all its sides.  \n\n3. **Finding the number of sides:** Since each side is 12 cm long, we can find the number of sides by dividing the perimeter by the length of one side: 108 cm / 12 cm/side = 9 sides.\n\n**Solution:** The polygon has 9 sides. \n"
