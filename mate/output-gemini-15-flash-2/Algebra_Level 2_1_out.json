So, the equation is:\n$(2m+7)(m-2) = 51$\n\n2. **Expand the equation:**\nWe expand the left side of the equation by using the distributive property (or FOIL):\n$2m^2 + 3m - 14 = 51$\n\n3. **Move all terms to one side:**\nSubtract 51 from both sides to get a quadratic equation:\n$2m^2 + 3m - 65 = 0$\n\n4. **Solve the quadratic equation:**\nThis quadratic equation can be solved by factoring:\n$(2m+13)(m-5)=0$ \nThis gives us two possible solutions:\n$2m+13 = 0$ or $m-5 = 0$\n\n5. **Solve for m:**\nSolving for m in each equation, we get:\n$m = -\\frac{13}{2}$ or $m = 5$\n\n6. **Choose the valid solution:**\nSince the dimensions of the field cannot be negative, the valid solution is $m = 5$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $m$ is $\\boxed{5}$. \n"
