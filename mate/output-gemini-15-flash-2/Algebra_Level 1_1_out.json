Set up an Equation:**\n   - Let 'x' represent the unknown number.\n   - We can express the problem as an equation: 64% * x = 16\n\n**3. Convert Percentage to Decimal:**\n   - Divide 64 by 100 to convert the percentage to a decimal: 64/100 = 0.64\n\n**4. Solve for 'x':**\n   - Rewrite the equation: 0.64 * x = 16\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 0.64: x = 16 / 0.64\n\n**5. Calculate the Solution:**\n   - x = 25\n\n**Answer:** Sixteen is 64% of **25**. \n"
