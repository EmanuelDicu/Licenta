            "gemini-1.5-flash": "1. **Identify the relevant measurements:** The problem gives us the radius of each circle, which is 5 inches.\n\n2. **Relate the circle's radius to the square's side length:** Notice that the diameter of each circle is equal to the side length of the square.\n\n3. **Calculate the diameter:** The diameter of a circle is twice its radius, so the diameter is 2 * 5 inches = 10 inches.\n\n4. **Determine the square's area:** The area of a square is side length squared. Therefore, the area of the square is 10 inches * 10 inches = **100 square inches**. \n"
