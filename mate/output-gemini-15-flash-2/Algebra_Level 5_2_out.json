        "correct_solution": "Completing the square gives us $(x+3)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 13 - c$. Since we want the radius to be 4, we must have $13 - c = 4^2$. It follows that $c = \\boxed{-3}$.",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "1. **Complete the square:** To find the radius, we need the equation in standard form. We complete the square for both $x$ and $y$ terms.\n   * For the $x$ terms, we take half of the coefficient of $x$ (which is 6), square it (which is 9), and add it to both sides of the equation: \n      $x^2 + 6x + 9 + y^2 - 4y + c = 9$.\n   * For the $y$ terms, we take half of the coefficient of $y$ (which is -4), square it (which is 4), and add it to both sides of the equation: \n      $x^2 + 6x + 9 + y^2 - 4y + 4 + c = 9 + 4$. \n2. **Rewrite the equation:**  We now rewrite the equation in standard form:\n   $(x + 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 13 - c$.\n3. **Identify the radius:** From the standard form of the equation, we see that the square of the radius is $13 - c$.\n4. **Solve for c:** We are given that the radius is 4. So, we have the equation: $13 - c = 4^2$.\n5. **Final answer:** Solving for $c$, we get $c = 13 - 16 = \\boxed{-3}$. \n"
