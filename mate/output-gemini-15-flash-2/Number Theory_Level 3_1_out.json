        "correct_solution": "We begin by listing all the factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. We can now start listing products of factors from least to greatest and find the first item in the second list that is not in the first; 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8... 8 is not a factor of 36, but is the product of 2 and 4. We can check that there are no smaller products of factors that do not divide 36: 5 and 7 are the only possibilities, and obviously neither of them can be products of factors of 36. $\\boxed{8}$ is thus the smallest such product.",

We need to find two factors whose product is not a factor of 36.\n \n Since the product of any two factors of 36 is also a factor of 36, the only way for $x\\cdot y$ to not be a factor of 36 is if $x$ and $y$ are both greater than 18.\n \n The smallest possible value of $x\\cdot y$ is then $19\\cdot 20 = \\boxed{380}$. \n"
