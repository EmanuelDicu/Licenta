We can group the terms as follows:\n\\[(x^4 - 2x^3) + (-x + 2) = 0.\\]Factoring out $x^3$ from the first group and $-1$ from the second group, we get\n\\[x^3 (x - 2) - 1(x - 2) = 0.\\]Now, we can factor out $(x - 2)$ to get\n\\[(x - 2)(x^3 - 1) = 0.\\]The first factor gives us the solution $x = 2$.  The second factor factors as a difference of cubes:\n\\[(x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0.\\]The quadratic factor has no real roots, so the only real root of the equation is $x = \\boxed{2}$.\n"
