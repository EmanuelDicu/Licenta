Dividing 3328 by 2, we get 1664.\n2. **Continue factoring:**  1664 is also even, so we can divide by 2 again, getting 832.\n3. **Continue factoring:**  832 is even, so we can divide by 2 again, getting 416.\n4. **Continue factoring:**  416 is even, so we can divide by 2 again, getting 208.\n5. **Continue factoring:**  208 is even, so we can divide by 2 again, getting 104.\n6. **Continue factoring:**  104 is even, so we can divide by 2 again, getting 52.\n7. **Continue factoring:**  52 is even, so we can divide by 2 again, getting 26.\n8. **Continue factoring:**  26 is even, so we can divide by 2 again, getting 13.\n9. **Final prime factor:**  13 is a prime number, since it is only divisible by 1 and itself. \n\nTherefore, the largest prime factor of 3328 is $\\boxed{13}$. \n"
