        "correct_solution": "The volume of a sphere with radius $r$ is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Here, we have $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=36\\pi$.  Dividing both sides by $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$ yields $r^3 = 27$; cube rooting both sides yields $r=3$.  The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$; here, our surface area is $4\\pi(3^2)=\\boxed{36\\pi}$.",

So, we have the equation: $36\\pi = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3$\n   - Dividing both sides by $\\pi$ and multiplying by $\\frac{3}{4}$ gives: $27 = r^3$\n   - Taking the cube root of both sides gives: $r = 3$ inches\n\n2. **Calculate the surface area:**\n   - The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula $SA = 4\\pi r^2$\n   - Substituting the value of $r = 3$ inches, we get: $SA = 4\\pi (3)^2$\n   - Simplifying, we have: $SA = 36\\pi$ square inches\n\nTherefore, the surface area of the sphere is $\\boxed{36\\pi}$ square inches. \n"
