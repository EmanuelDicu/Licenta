Solve for x:**\n\n* **Set each factor to zero:**\n\n   (x - 2) = 0  or  (x - 1) = 0  or  (x\u00b2 + x + 1) = 0\n\n* **Solve the linear equations:**\n\n    x = 2  or  x = 1\n\n* **Solve the quadratic equation:** The quadratic equation x\u00b2 + x + 1 = 0 does not factor easily.  We can use the quadratic formula:\n    \n    x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a  where a = 1, b = 1, and c = 1\n    x = (-1 \u00b1 \u221a(-3)) / 2\n    x = (-1 \u00b1 i\u221a3) / 2  (where 'i' is the imaginary unit)\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe real roots of the equation x\u2074 - 2x\u00b3 - x + 2 = 0 are:\n* **x = 2**\n* **x = 1** \n"
