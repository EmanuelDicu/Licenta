        "correct_solution": "A sphere with radius 9 inches has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(9^3)=4\\cdot 9^2 \\cdot 3\\pi$ cubic inches; twice this is $8\\cdot 9^2\\cdot 3 \\pi$ cubic inches.  Let the radius of the larger sphere be $r$, so we have \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3= 8\\cdot 9^2\\cdot 3\\pi .\\] Solving for $r$ yields \\[r^3 =2\\cdot 9^3 \\Rightarrow r = 9\\sqrt[3]{2}.\\]  The diameter is twice this value, or $18\\sqrt[3]{2}$ inches.  Hence $a=18$, $b=2$, and $a+b=\\boxed{20}$.",

We have (4/3)\u03c0R\u00b3 = 1944\u03c0.\n   * Dividing both sides by (4/3)\u03c0 gives R\u00b3 = 1458.\n   * Taking the cube root of both sides gives R = \u00b3\u221a1458 = \u00b3\u221a(27 * 54) = 3\u00b3\u221a54 inches.\n\n4. **Find the diameter of the larger sphere:**\n   * The diameter is twice the radius, so the diameter is 2 * 3\u00b3\u221a54 = 6\u00b3\u221a54 inches.\n\n5. **Compute a + b:**\n   * The diameter is in the form a\u00b3\u221ab, where a = 6 and b = 54.\n   * Therefore, a + b = 6 + 54 = **60**. \n"
