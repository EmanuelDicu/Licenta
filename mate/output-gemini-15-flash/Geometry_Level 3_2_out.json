        "problem": "A telephone pole is supported by a steel cable which extends from the top of the pole to a point on the ground 3 meters from its base. When Leah walks 2.5 meters from the base of the pole toward the point where the cable is attached to the ground, her head just touches the cable. Leah is 1.5 meters tall. How many meters tall is the pole?",
        "correct_solution": "First, let us draw a diagram (not to scale!): [asy]\npair A,B,C,D,E;\n\nA=(0,0);\nB=(0,4.5);\nC=(6,0);\nD=(5,0);\nE=(5,0.75);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(D--E);\n\nlabel(\"A\",A,W);\nlabel(\"B\",B,W);\nlabel(\"C\",C+(0.4,0));\nlabel(\"D\",D, NW);\nlabel(\"E\",E+(0.3,0.2));\n[/asy] Here, $AB$ is the telephone pole and $C$ is the point in the ground where the cable $BC$ is anchored. The key is to recognize that $ABC$ is a right triangle since the telephone pole is upright. Meanwhile, Leah stands at $D$ and touches the cable at $E,$ so $DEC$ is another right triangle. Not only that, but we see that $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle DEC$ thanks to AA similarity.\n\nFrom the problem, We have that $DE = 1.5\\text{m},$ $AC = 3\\text{m},$ and $AD = 2.5\\text{m}.$ Therefore, $DC = AC - AD = 0.5\\text{m}.$ We desire $AB.$ From $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle DEC,$ we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{AB}{AC} &= \\frac{DE}{DC} \\\\\n\\frac{AB}{3\\text{m}} &= \\frac{1.5\\text{m}}{0.5\\text{m}} = 3 \\\\\nAB &= 3 \\cdot 3\\text{m} = \\boxed{9}\\text{ meters}.\n\\end{align*}",

            "gemini-1.5-flash": "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Visualize the Problem:**\n\nImagine a right triangle where:\n\n* The pole is the vertical side (height).\n* The distance from the pole's base to the cable's ground attachment is the horizontal side (3 meters).\n* The cable is the hypotenuse.\n\n**2. Identify Similar Triangles:**\n\n* There's a larger triangle formed by the pole, the cable, and the ground.\n* There's a smaller triangle formed by Leah's height, the distance she walks (2.5 meters), and the segment of the cable from her head to the ground attachment point.\n\nThese two triangles are similar because they share the same angles.\n\n**3. Set Up a Proportion:**\n\nSince the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. Let 'x' be the height of the pole:\n\n*  x / 3 = 1.5 / 2.5 \n\n**4. Solve for 'x':**\n\n* Cross-multiply: 2.5x = 4.5\n* Divide both sides by 2.5: x = 1.8\n\n**Solution:** The pole is 1.8 meters tall. \n"
