        "correct_solution": "Let the smallest common solution be $a$. The given system of congruences is \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv 1\\equiv -1\\pmod 2,\\\\\na\\equiv 2\\equiv -1\\pmod 3,\\\\\na\\equiv 3\\equiv -1\\pmod 4,\\\\\na\\equiv 4\\equiv -1\\pmod 5.\n\\end{align*} Note that if $a\\equiv-1\\pmod 4$, then $a\\equiv-1\\pmod 2$ as well,  so we need only consider the final three congruences. Since $\\gcd(3,4)=\\gcd(4,5)=\\gcd(3,5)=1$, we have $$a\\equiv -1\\pmod{3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5},$$ that is, $a\\equiv 59\\pmod{60}$.\n\nSo $a$ has a lower bound of $59$, but $59$ also happens to satisfy all of the original congruences. Thus, $a=\\boxed{59}$.",

This suggests we might find a solution by looking at numbers of the form  *divisor - 1*.\n\n**Part 2: Checking the pattern**\n\nLet's try the first few numbers of this form:\n\n* 1 - 1 = 0 (doesn't satisfy any conditions)\n* 2 - 1 = 1  (satisfies condition a)\n* 3 - 1 = 2 (satisfies conditions a and b)\n* 4 - 1 = 3 (satisfies conditions a, b, and c)\n* 5 - 1 = 4 (satisfies all conditions a, b, c, and d)\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe least positive integer that satisfies all the conditions is **4**. \n"
